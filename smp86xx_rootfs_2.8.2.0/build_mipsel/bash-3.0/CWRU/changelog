				 --------
[bash-2.05 released]

				   4/10
				   ----
redir.c
	- check return value of fclose() in write_here_document() for error
	  returns; don't just rely on fwrite() failing

support/bashbug.sh
	- set TMPDIR to /tmp if it's null or unset
	- use $TMPDIR in the TEMP tempfile name template
	- fixed the call to `mktemp', if it exists, to make it more portable

jobs.c
	- if WCONTINUED is not defined, define it to 0 and add a define for
	  WIFCONTINUED(wstatus) which expands to 0
	- add WCONTINUED to the flags passed to waitpid(2) in waitchld()
	- don't increment children_exited if waitpid's status is WIFCONTINUED,
	  since we don't want to call a SIGCHLD trap handler in this case
	- in waitchld(), we set child->running to 1 if WIFCONTINUED(status)
	  is non-zero
	- make sure pretty_print_job doesn't check for the core dump bit if
	  the process has been continued; it's only valid if the job is dead
	- in set_job_status_and_cleanup, set the job to JRUNNING if job_state
	  is non-zero and the job was previously marked as JSTOPPED

configure.in
	- add -DBROKEN_DIRENT_D_INO to interix LOCAL_CFLAGS

lib/glob/glob.c
	- if BROKEN_DIRENT_D_INO is defined, define REAL_DIR_ENTRY to 1

jobs.c
	- in kill_pid, we only need to block and unblock SIGCHLD if the
	  `group' argument is non-zero, since otherwise we just call `kill'
	  on the pid argument

version.c
	- update copyright date to 2001

bashline.c
	- prog_complete_return needs to take a `const char *' as its first
	  argument
	- history_completion_generator needs to take a `const char *' as
	  its first argument, and `text' needs to be a `const char *'

				   4/11
				   ----
redir.c
	- fixed a weird typo in redir_special_open, case RF_DEVFD, added
	  call to all_digits before call to legal_number
	- fixed do_redirection_internal to call legal_number instead of atol(3)
	  when translating r_duplicating_{in,out}put_word, so it handles
	  overflow better
	- produce an error message in redirection_error for out-of-range
	  file descriptors
	- change allocation strategy in redirection_error so we don't have to
	  malloc scratch memory if redirection_expand() fails

jobs.h
	- added defines for `running' member of a struct process

general.c
	- fix legal_number to return 0 when strtol(3) reports overflow or
	  underflow

parse.y
	- changed read_token_word to call legal_number instead of atoi(3)

input.c
	- return -1/EBADF from close_buffered_fd if fd is < 0

command.h
	- fixed bogus comment about IS_DESCRIPTOR in description of the
	  REDIRECTEE struct

print_cmd.c
	- change cprintf's 'd' modifier code to display negative numbers as
	  an out-of-range value.  We can do this only because the only use
	  of %d is to output file descriptor numbers in redirections

support/mksignames.c
	- need to include config.h to get a possible value for
	  UNUSABLE_RT_SIGNALS

				   4/16
				   ----
lib/readline/doc/rluser.texinfo
	- corrected a small error in one description of M-DEL

				   4/17
				   ----
stringlib.c
	- need to initialize `ind' before calls to RESIZE_MALLOCED_BUFFER
	  in strcreplace()

support/bashversion.c
	- new file, prints bash version information

Makefile.in
	- rules for building bashversion and linking it to version.o

				   4/24
				   ----
conftypes.h
	- new file with HOSTTYPE, OSTYPE, MACHTYPE, etc. defines from
	  variables.h

variables.h, version.c
	- include conftypes.h

patchlevel.h
	- new file, contains define for PATCHLEVEL.  Doing away with the old
	  scheme of having the information in configure.in

version.c
	- include patchlevel.h

Makefile.in
	- run bashversion -p to find patch level rather than have configure
	  substitute in a value
	- pass -S ${top_srcdir} to support/mkversion.sh

support/mkversion.sh
	- don't put PATCHLEVEL define into version.h, but accept and ignore
	  a -p option
	- take a new -S srcdir option
	- find the patch level by parsing it out of patchlevel.h

configure.in
	- hard-code BASHVERS assignment instead of reading it from a file
	- remove BASHPATCH; don't substitute it

_distribution,_patchlevel
	- removed

				   4/26
				   ----
shell.c
	- call init_noninteractive() in open_shell_script if forced_interactive
	  is non-zero (the shell was started with -i) and fd_is_tty is 0
	  (the script file is a real file, not something like /dev/stdin),
	  since it wasn't done earlier

builtins/printf.def
	- change for POSIX.2 compliance when conversion errors are encountered
	  when processing %d, %u, and floating point conversion operators
	  (print a warning message, return the value accumulated at the time
	  of the error -- which is always 0 -- and exit with a non-zero status)

command.h
	- added CMD_COMMAND_BUILTIN for use by the `command' builtin and the
	  code in execute_cmd.c

builtins/command.def
	- add CMD_COMMAND_BUILTIN to the created command's flags

				    5/1
				    ---
configure.in
	- add call to AC_C_CONST to test `const' compiler behavior
	- add call to AC_C_INLINE to test `inline' compiler behavior
	- add call to AC_C_STRINGIZE to test cpp #x stringizing operator

config.h.in
	- add `#undef const' for configure to substitute
	- add `#undef inline' for configure to substitute
	- add `#undef HAVE_STRINGIZE' for configure to substitute

include/stdc.h
	- remove code that defines or undefines `const' and `inline'
	- change the __STRING macro to be defined depending on the value
	  of HAVE_STRINGIZE

lib/malloc/malloc.c
	- change the __STRING macro to be defined depending on the value
	  of HAVE_STRINGIZE

lib/readline/{readline,rlprivate}.h
	- moved rl_get_termcap to readline.h, making it a public function

lib/readline/readline.h
	- new #define, RL_READLINE_VERSION, hex-encoded library version
	  number, currently set to 0x0402
	- new public int variable, rl_readline_version

lib/readline/readline.c
	- #define RL_READLINE_VERSION if it is not already defined (which it
	  should be in readline.h)
	- initialize rl_readline_version to RL_READLINE_VERSION

lib/readline/doc/rltech.texinfo
	- documented rl_get_termcap
	- documented rl_readline_version

jobs.c
	- job_exit_status should return an int, not a WAIT (undetected
	  before because on most POSIX-like systems a WAIT is really an int)

builtins/evalfile.c
	- added FEVAL_REGFILE (file must be a regular file) to accepted
	   _evalfile flags
	- fc_execute_file() adds FEVAL_REGFILE to _evalfile flags.  This
	  means that startup files and files read with `.' no longer need
	  to be regular files

				    5/2
				    ---

lib/termcap/Makefile.in
	- fix target for installed termcap library (normally unused)

lib/tilde/Makefile.in
	- fix install target to install in $(libdir) (normally unused)

Makefile.in
	- don't make $(man3dir) since there's nothing installed there

Makefile.in,doc/Makefile.in
	- change `man1ext' to `.1', `man3ext' to `.3'
	- change appropriate install targets to use new values of man[13]ext
	- use `test ...' instead of `[...]'
	- add support for DESTDIR root installation prefix, for package
	  building (installdirs, install, install-strip, uninstall targets)

builtins/common.c
	- new function int get_exitstat(WORD_LIST *list) returns an eight-bit
	  exit status value for use in return, exit, logout builtins

builtins/common.h
	- extern declaration for get_exitstat()

builtins/{exit,return}.def
	- call get_exitstat where appropriate

builtins/printf.def
	- add support for "'" flag character as posix 1003.2-200x d6 says
	- fix core dump when user-supplied field width or precision is 0
	- fix to printstr() to handle zero-length precision with `%b' format
	  specifier (printf '%.0b-%.0s\n' foo bar)
	- fix to printstr() to treat a negative field width as a positive
	  field width with left-justification
	- fix to mklong to avoid static buffers, which can always be overrun
	  by someone sufficiently motivated

bashline.c
	- change var in add_host_name to type `size_t' for passing to xrealloc

				    5/3
				    ---
execute_cmd.c
	- change restore_signal_mask to accept a sigset_t *, since a sigset_t
	  may not fit into a pointer, change call

unwind_prot.c
	- use a union UWP in restore_variable when restoring a variable whose
	  size is the same as sizeof(int), the reverse of the method used to
	  store it in unwind_protect_int

builtins/printf.def
	- use a #define LENMODS containing the length modifiers instead of
	  testing against each possible modifier character, save any mod
	  character found
	- add support for ISO C99 length specifiers `j', `t', and `z'
	- if `L' modifier is supplied with a floating point conversion char,
	  pass a `long double' to printf if HAVE_LONG_DOUBLE is defined

configure.in,config.h.in
	- call AC_C_LONG_DOUBLE to check for `long double'; define
	  HAVE_LONG_DOUBLE if supported

bashline.c
	- fix an inadvertantly-unclosed comment in attempt_shell_completion
	- make set_saved_history return a value
	- make dynamic_complete_history return a useful value

{make_cmd,execute_cmd,shell,subst,trap,variables,input,unwind_prot,test,
pcomplete}.c
	- removed some declared-but-unused variables

builtins/{cd,enable,fc,set,setattr,type,umask,printf,complete}.def
	- removed some declared-but-unused variables

lib/sh/{zread,netopen}.c
	- removed some declared-but-unused variables

execute_cmd.c
	- in execute_arith_command, use a long variable to hold the result
	  of evalexp(), since that's what it returns

builtins/evalstring.c
	- make cat_file return -1 on a read or write error

lib/sh/stringlib.c
	- make merge_stringlists() return the right value

				    5/7

pcomplete.c
	- remove typo that caused empty declaration (;;)

parse.y
	- fix yyerror() to accept a single string argument; fix callers

trap.c
	- cast pointer to long instead of int when printing message with
	  internal_warning() in run_pending_traps()

subst.c
	- fix process_substitute to handle stdin being closed

test.c
	- change `while' to `if' in and() and or(), since the loop isn't
	  actually performed -- there's an unconditional `return' in the
	  loop body
	- check for integer overflow of arguments to `-t'

lib/sh/netopen.c
	- change _getserv() to reject negative port/service numbers

expr.c
	- fix strlong() to not convert the base specification from long to
	  int before checking for overflow, since truncation on machines
	  where sizeof(int) != sizeof(long) may mask errors

builtins/{jobs,kill,wait}.def
	- use legal_number instead of atoi when converting strings to pid_t;
	  check for numeric overflow

input.c
	- fix for cygwin in b_fill_buffer -- off-by-one error when checking
	  buffer for \r\n termination

general.h
	- new #define INT_STRLEN_BOUND(t), computes max length of string
	  representing integer value of type T, possibly including a sign
	  character
	- include <limits.h> if it's present

{execute_cmd,findcmd,test}.c
	- don't include <limits.h>, since general.h does it now

{execute_cmd,lib/sh/itos,pcomplete,print_cmd,subst,variables}.c
	- use INT_STRLEN_BOUND instead of static array sizes when converting
	  various strings to integer values

shell.h
	- struct fd_bitmap now uses an `int' size, since it's bounded by
	  the number of file descriptors, which must fit into an `int'

execute_cmd.c
	- FD_BITMAP_DEFAULT_SIZE is now 32, not 32L
	- new_fd_bitmap takes an `int' size parameter, not a `long'

execute_cmd.h
	- change prototype for new_fd_bitmap()

test.c
	- fix test_stat to check for overflow when parsing the integer file
	  descriptor number; return ENOENT instead of EBADF for files that
	  are not open

hashlib.c
	- don't discard the upper 32 bits of the random value, if present

lib/readline/shell.c
	- use the same INT_STRLEN_BOUND mechanism to decide how much space to
	  allocated in sh_set_lines_and_columns

				    5/8
				    ---
aclocal.m4
	- add check for libtinfo (termcap-specific portion of ncurses-5.2) to
	  BASH_CHECK_LIB_TERMCAP
	- new macro, RL_LIB_READLINE_VERSION, checks version of installed
	  readline library and (optionally) writes version #defines to
	  config.h.  Bash doesn't use the version defines

configure.in
	- call RL_LIB_READLINE_VERSION instead of support/rlvers.sh

execute_cmd.c
	- fix execute_shell_script and the WHITECHAR and STRINGCHAR macros
	  to check array bounds before indexing into the sample string

unwind_prot.[ch]
	- import new versions submitted by Paul Eggert <eggert@twinsun.com>
	  with a couple of changes for backwards compatibility, so the rest
	  of the source doesn't need to be changed yet

jobs.c
	- use unwind_protect_var on last_made_pid in run_sigchld_trap

builtins/bind.def
	- use unwind_protect_var on rl_outstream

general.c
	- rework print_rlimtype to use INT_STRLEN_BOUND and handle the
	  most negative number correctly

expr.c
	- `tokval' should have been a `long', since all arithmetic is done
	  as longs

builtins/history.def
	- consolidate tests for valid history position in one block to
	  avoid duplicate code and strings

builtins/ulimit.def
	- fix check for overflow when setting limit to work when int is 32
	  bits and RLIMTYPE is 64

lib/sh/tmpfile.c
	- don't truncate the result of time(3) to int; just use time_t,
	  since it's being assigned to an `unsigned long'

mailcheck.c
	- use legal_number instead of atoi in time_to_check_mail() to catch
	  more numeric errors; consolidate error checking in one block
	- last_time_mail_checked should be a time_t

				    5/9
				    ---
builtins/set.def
	- recognize `set [-+]o nolog' if HISTORY is defined

bashline.c
	- new variable `dont_save_function_defs', set by `set -o nolog';
	  currently ignored

command.h
	- the `dest' member of a REDIRECTEE is now an `int'

parse.y,redir.c
	- changed uses of `redir.test' (where redir is a REDIRECTEE) since
	  it's now an int

lib/readline/rlstdc.h
	- don't mess around with `const', rely on configure to supply a
	  proper definition if the compiler doesn't support it

lib/tilde/tilde.h
	- include <config.h> if HAVE_CONFIG_H is defined
	- don't mess around with `const', rely on configure

builtins/shopt.def
	- new read-only `shopt' option, login_shell, non-zero if shell is a
	  login shell (as decided by shell.c)
	- new function set_login_shell(), sets shopt private value of
	  login_shell

builtins/common.h
	- new extern declaration for set_login_shell

shell.c
	- call set_login_shell after setting value of login_shell (in
	  main() and set_shell_name())

parse.y
	- added new `\A' prompt string escape sequence:  time in 24-hour
	  HH:MM format

configure.in, config.h.in
	- check for <grp.h>, define HAVE_GRP_H if found

builtins/complete.def
	- add new `-A group/-g' option to complete group names

pcomplete.h
	- new define for CA_GROUP, used with group name completion

pcomplete.c
	- add code to support CA_GROUP group name completion

	- new function, bash_groupname_completion_function(), supports
	  programmable completion of group names

bashline.h
	- extern declaration for bash_groupname_completion_function

lib/readline/bind.c
	- new inputrc variable, `match-hidden-files', controls completion
	  matching files beginning with a `.' (on Unix)

	- new variable, _rl_match_hidden_files, mirrors `match-hidden-files'
	  inputrc variable

lib/readline/rlprivate.h
	- extern declaration for _rl_match_hidden_files

builtins/hash.def
	- new `-t' option to list hash values for each filename argument

builtins/read.def

	- check for arithmetic overflow with -t and -n options

input.c
	- check for read error before doing \r\n translation on cygwin in
	  b_fill_buffer
	- reset bp->b_used to 0 instead of leaving it at -1 on read error
	  in b_fill_buffer

builtins/shopt.def
	- new functions, shopt_setopt(name, mode) and
	  shopt_listopt(name, mode) to give the rest of the shell an easy
	  interface

builtins/common.h
	- extern declarations for shopt_setopt and shopt_listopt

shell.c
	- new invocation options -O and +O, to list or set/unset shopt
	  options like +o/-o sets and unsets `set -o' options

doc/{bash.1,bashref.texi}
	- document `set -o nolog'
	- document `login_shell' shopt option

				   5/10
				   ----
configure.in
	- fix AC_CHECK_PROG(ar, ...)
	- add AC_CHECK_TYPE for ssize_t

config.h.in
	- new #undef for ssize_t

lib/sh/zread.c
	- int -> ssize_t fixes to mirror modern declarations of read and write
	- the `off' variable in zsyncfd should be an off_t since it computes
	  a file offset
	- the local buffer `lbuf' is now char, since it's not nice to pass
	  unsigned char * to read(2), and the values from it are assigned to
	  a char anyway
	- lind and lused are now size_t, since they index into a buffer
	- set lused to 0 on read error

lib/sh/zwrite.c
	- change second argument to type `char *', since ISO C says you have
	  to pass a `char *' to `write'

externs.h
	- fix extern declarations of zread, zread1, zreadc, and zwrite
	- prototype extern declaration of qsort_string_compare
	- add extern declaration for history_delimiting_chars() from parse.y

input.h
	- b_used and b_inputp members ofr struct BSTREAM are now size_t

builtins/evalstring.c
	- the number of chars read with zread in cat_file should be assigned
	  to a variable of type ssize_t

input.c
	- the number of chars read with zread in b_fill_buffer should be
	  assigned to a variable of type ssize_t
	- `localbuf' is now type char[], since POSIX says you shouldn't pass
	  unsigned char * to read(2)
	- in getc_with_restart(), use a variable of type unsigned char to
	  get a value from the local buffer and return it
	- in ungetc_with_restart, explicitly return the character arg passed
	  to avoid relying on localbuf being unsigned char

subst.c
	- the number of chars read with zread in read_comsub should be
	  assigned to a variable of type ssize_t

mksyntax.c
	- instead of casting to unsigned char * in addcstr, use a variable
	  of type unsigned char and let the compiler do the work

parse.y
	- instead of casting to unsigned char * in yy_readline_get, use a
	  variable of type unsigned char and let the compiler do the work
	- ditto for yy_string_get and shell_getc (cast to unsigned char)

subst.c
	- instead of casting to unsigned char when assigning to ifscmap in
	  expand_word_internal, use a variable of type unsigned char and
	  let the compiler do the work

lib/sh/strtrans.c
	- instead of casting to unsigned char in ansic_quote, use a variable
	  of type unsigned char and let the compiler do the work

	- remove extern declarations for zwrite and run_trap_cleanup; they're
	  in externs.h
	- prototype cat_file forward declaration

Makefile.in
	- remove -I$(includedir) from INCLUDES and SUBDIR_INCLUDES

aclocal.m4
	- change RL_LIB_READLINE_VERSION to set RL_PREFIX, RL_LIBDIR,
	  and RL_INCLUDEDIR to what it used to test the installed readline
	  library version for use by the caller
	- change RL_LIB_READLINE_VERSION to not compute ac_cv_rl_prefix if
	  the caller has already assigned it a value
	- rename _rl_prefix -> ac_cv_rl_prefix, _rl_libdir -> ac_cv_rl_libdir,
	  _rl_includedir -> ac_cv_rl_includedir

configure.in
	- change testing of whether to use the value of
	  $opt_with_installed_readline to be != no, to allow the user to
	  specify a prefix where the installed readline library may be found
	- if --with-installed-readline=PREFIX is supplied, set ac_cv_rl_prefix
	  to PREFIX before calling RL_LIB_READLINE_VERSION
	- if --with-installed-readline[=PREFIX] is supplied, don't set
	  RL_LIBDIR and RL_INCLUDEDIR; let RL_LIB_READLINE_VERSION take care
	  of it, set RL_INCLUDE=-I${RL_INCLUDEDIR}
	- if --with-installed-readline[=PREFIX] is supplied, and we're
	  linking with the history library, assign $RL_LIBDIR to HIST_LIBDIR
	  so we use the same version of the installed readline and history
	  libraries

Makefile.in, builtins/Makefile.in
	- have configure substitute RL_INCLUDEDIR, set RL_INCLUDEDIR variable

doc/bashref.texi
	- updated description of --with-installed-readline configure option

{execute_cmd,expr,findcmd,jobs,mailcheck,nojobs,pcomplete,print_cmd,redir,
shell}.c
	- prototype all static forward function declarations

pcomplete.c
	- changed some function parameters to `const char *' to avoid discarding
	  const qualifier

	- make_bare_word, make_word_flags, and make_word now take a
	  `const char *' string argument

make_cmd.h
	- changed extern declarations for make_bare_word and make_word

print_cmd.c
	- cprintf now takes a `const char *' as its first argument, like
	  xprintf and printf
	- the conditional define for xprintf should have been HAVE_VPRINTF,
	  not HAVE_VFPRINTF

shell.c
	- in isnetconn(), the return value of sizeof() is size_t

aclocal.m4
	- add inclusion of stddef.h if STDC_HEADERS is defined to 1 in
	  BASH_CHECK_TYPE

	- dollar_dollar_pid is now a `pid_t' instead of `int'

variables.c
	- sbrand() now takes an `unsigned long' to set the seed value
	- changed last_random_value to type int, since it's always between
	  0 and 32767
	- use strtoul to convert the value in assign_random instead of atoi
	- take out casts in any arguments to sbrand()
	- take out cast to int in call to inttostr in set_ppid()

subst.c
	- don't cast last_asynchronous_pid when passing to itos()

{sig,subst}.c

history,jobs,pushd,read,set,trap,umask,
	- prototype all static forward function declarations

builtins/read.def
	- reset_eol_delim now takes a `char *' arg, since that's what the
	  unwind_protect functions pass it, and it ignores its arguments
	  anyway

lib/readline/{histsearch,input,kill,rltty,search,vi_mode}.c
	- prototype all static forward function declarations

lib/tilde/tilde.c
	- prototype all static forward function declarations
	- tilde_find_prefix, tilde_find_suffix, isolate_tilde_prefix, and
	  glue_prefix_and_suffix now take `const char *' arguments where
	  appropriate

configure.in,config.h.in
	- check for vsnprintf, define HAVE_VSNPRINTF if found

lib/readline/display.c
	- use vsnprintf() in rl_message if it's available; if we don't, at
	  least set the last character in msg_buf to 0 to avoid overrun --
	  we really can't do anything about overflow at this point.  if it's
	  available, this fixes buffer overflow problems in rl_message

				   5/15
				   ----
lib/readline/histexpand.c
	- in get_history_word_specifier, allow any character to terminate
	  a `:first-' modifier, not just `:' and null.  This is what csh
	  appears to do.  This allows things like `!:0- xyzzy' to replace the
	  last argument with xyzzy

				   5/18
				   ----
configure.in, config.h.in
	- check for <stdint.h>, define HAVE_STDINT_H if found

	- add snprintf.c/snprintf.o

configure.in, config.h.in
	- add checks for snprintf, asprintf, vasprintf, with appropriate
	  cpp defines

lib/readline/{rldefs,xmalloc}.h, lib/readline/xmalloc.c
	- xmalloc and xrealloc now take `size_t' arguments, like their bash
	  counterparts

externs.h,lib/sh/itos.c
	- inttostr and itos now take `long' arguments
	- inttostr takes a `size_t' argument for the buffer size

{expr,lib/malloc/malloc,variables,general}.c
	- fixed calls to itos() by removing casts, etc.

subst.[ch]
	- get_dollar_var_value now takes a long, not an int
	- sub_append_number now takes a long, not an int

subst.c
	- in parameter_brace_expand_word, use a long and legal_number to
	  translate ${N}, to avoid overflow
	- in parameter_brace_expand_length, use a long and legal_number to
	  translate ${#N}, to avoid overflow
	- in do_array_element_assignment, array_expand_index,
	  array_value_internal, use arrayind_t instead of int
	- let verify_substring_values take long * arguments for the return
	  value of evalexp()
	- pass long * arguments to verify_substring_values in
	  parameter_brace_substring
	- parameter_brace_expand_length now returns `long'
	- parameter_brace_expand now uses a long variable for the return
	  value of parameter_brace_expand_length
	- param_expand now uses a long variable for the return value from
	  evalexp
	- array_length reference now returns an `arrayind_t', since it can
	  return the num_elements member of an array, which is of type
	  arrayind_t

subst.h
	- array_expand_index now returns an `arrayind_t'

array.[ch]
	- array_subrange now takes arrayind_t arguments, not `int'
	- dup_array_subrange now uses arrayind_t local variable to do
	  array indexing
	- use long to print array indices in print_element

variables.c
	- null_array_assign, assign_dirstack, bind_array_variable
	  now take arrayind_t arguments as array indices
	- assign_array_var_from_word_list, assign_array_var_from_string,
	  unbind_array_element now use arrayind_t local variables for
	  array indexing

variables.h
	- change extern declaration of bind_array_variable

builtins/common.[ch]
	- get_numeric_arg now returns a `long', since it usually returns
	  the value of legal_number()

builtins/history.def
	- convert string argument to int only if it's in range

builtins/pushd.def
	- set_dirstack_element and get_dirstack_element now take `long'
	  index arguments
	- get_dirstack_index now takes a `long' index argument, since it's
	  passed the converted value from legal_number

lib/sh/timeval.c
	- in print_timeval, don't assume that the number of minutes fits into
	  an int, since it's just seconds/60.

lib/sh/clock.c
	- ditto for print_clock_t

				   5/22
				   ----
shell.c
	- since the -O option settings may possibly be overridden by the
	  normal shell initialization or posix initialization, save the
	  invocation options on an alist (with add_shopt_to_alist) and
	  process them after basic initialization (with run_shopt_alist)

				   5/23
				   ----
trap.h
	- new define, BASH_NSIG, all system signals plus special bash traps

trap.c, builtins/trap.def
	- use BASH_NSIG for array bounds and loops where appropriate

trap.c
	- change decode_signal to disallow numeric signal numbers above
	  NSIG -- this means you can only reference special traps like
	  DEBUG by name
	- new SPECIAL_TRAP(s) macro to test whether s is one of the special
	  bash traps (currently DEBUG and EXIT)
	- change reset_or_restore_signal_handlers so command substitution
	  doesn't inherit the debug trap (like ksh93), and child processes
	  don't have to rely on initialize_traps being run to get rid of
	  any debug trap

support/mksignames.c
	- add extra "ERR" signal name, value NSIG+1, allocate space for it
	  and write it out in signal_names[]

trap.h
	- new define: ERROR_TRAP == NSIG+1, change BASH_NSIG to NSIG+2
	- extern declarations for set_error_trap, run_error_trap
	- new define: TRAP_STRING(s), expands to trap_list[s] if signal S
	  is trapped and not ignored, NULL otherwise

trap.c
	- add ERROR_TRAP to SPECIAL_TRAPS define
	- initialize ERROR_TRAP stuff in initialize_traps
	- new function: set_error_trap(command), sets the ERR trap string
	- new function: run_error_trap(command), runs the ERR trap string
	- set trap string for ERROR_TRAP to NULL in free_trap_strings
	- change reset_or_restore_signal_handlers so child processes don't
	  inherit the ERR trap
	- add case to call run_error_trap in maybe_call_trap_handler

execute_cmd.c
	- in execute_command_internal, keep track of ERR trap and call it if
	  necessary
	- use TRAP_STRING to get the value of debug and error traps
	- in execute_function, arrange things so the ERR trap is not inherited
	  by shell functions, and is saved and restored like the DEBUG trap

doc/{bash.1,bashref.texi}
	- documented new ERR trap

tests/{trap.{tests,right},trap2.sub,trap2a.sub}
	- added ERR trap tests

subst.c
	- on machines without /dev/fd, change the named pipe fifo list to a
	  list of structs containing pathname and proc information
	- change unlink_fifo_list to kill the proc in the fifo list with
	  signal 0 and not remove the fifo if the proc is still alive.  This
	  should fix the problem on those backward systems without /dev/fd
	  where fifos were removed when a job using process substitution was
	  suspended

				   5/24
				   ----
examples/loadables/getconf.h
	- new file, with basic defines needed to make getconf work minimally
	  on POSIX systems without the necessary definitions

examples/loadables/getconf.c
	- replacement functions for confstr, sysconf, pathconf for systems
	  that lack them, providing a minimal posix interface
	- heavily augmented getconf, now supports all POSIX.1-200x,
	  POSIX.2-200x, Solaris 7, AIX 4.2 getconf variables

				   5/29
				   ----
builtins/setattr.def
	- make `readonly', `export', and `declare' print `invisible' variables
	  as just a command and variable name, without a value, when listing
	  all variables (as POSIX.2-200x d6 requires)

				   5/30
				   ----

configure.in
	- upgraded to autoconf-2.50 on main development machine, so require
	  autoconf-2.50 in preparation for using some if its new features
	- call AC_C_PROTOTYPES
	- remove call to AC_EXEEXT, which now does the wrong thing
	- changed AC_INIT to new flavor

	- AC_CONFIG_HEADER -> AC_CONFIG_HEADERS
	- AC_RETSIGTYPE -> AC_TYPE_SIGNAL

configure.in, aclocal.m4, config.h.in
	- removed call to BASH_LARGE_FILE_SUPPORT, use AC_SYS_LARGEFILE

doc/bashref.texi
	- document new `--enable-largefile' configure option

lib/readline/readline.c

	  local_prompt and local_prompt_prefix get set correctly

				    6/6
				    ---
lib/readline/complete.c
	- don't append `/' or ` ' to a match when completing a symlink that
	  resolves to a directory, unless the match doesn't add anything
	  to the word.  This means that a tab will complete the word up to
	  the full name, but not add anything, and a subsequent tab will add
	  a slash.  Change to append_to_match; callers changed

hashlib.c
	- new function, hash_table_nentries (table), returns the number of
	  items in TABLE

hashlib.h
	- extern declaration for hash_table_nentries

configure.in
	- configure without bash malloc on openbsd; they claim it needs
	  eight-bit alignment (which the bash malloc provides, but...)

				    7/2
				    ---
stringlib.c
	- only call RESIZE_MALLOCED_BUFFER from strsub() if the replacement
	  string length is > 0, avoid possible hangs if replacement is null

subst.c
	- don't include input.h; no longer needed

configure.in
	- remove calls to AC_SYS_RESTARTABLE_SYSCALLS and
	  BASH_SYS_RESTARTABLE_SYSCALLS; the results are no longer used

	- remove define for HAVE_RESTARTABLE_SYSCALLS

aclocal.m4
	- removed definition of BASH_SYS_RESTARTABLE_SYSCALLS; no longer used

execute_cmd.c

	  command, so it can be used to return from an enclosing function.
	  This is as ksh (88 and 93) does it

lib/readline/vi_mode.c
	- fix trivial typo in declaration of vi_motion; `t' appears twice;
	  the second instance should be `T'

				    7/3
				    ---
configure.in
	- don't add -static to LDFLAGS on Solaris 2.x.  This means that the
	  auxiliary programs will be built as dynamic executables, but that
	  should do no harm

				    7/5
				    ---
lib/glob/fnmatch.c
	- fix the code that processes **(pattern) to short-circuit if the
	  pattern is ill-formed or lacks a trailing `)'  -- this fixes the
	  segfault on **(/*)

Makefile.in, builtins/Makefile.in
	- split CCFLAGS into CCFLAGS_FOR_BUILD and CFLAGS, to aid in
	  cross-compilation
	- build programs that use $(CC_FOR_BUILD) using $(CCFLAGS_FOR_BUILD)

configure.in, config.h.in
	- check for getaddrinfo(3), define HAVE_GETADDRINFO if found

lib/sh/netopen.c
	- implemented a version of _netopen (_netopen6) that uses
	  getaddrinfo(3) if available, use if HAVE_GETADDRINFO is defined.
	  old _netopen is _netopen4; _netopen now calls either _netopen6
	  or _netopen4 as appropriate

				    7/9
				    ---
builtins/exit.def
	- don't source ~/.bash_logout if subshell_environment is non-zero

execute_command.c
	- in execute_until_or_while, handle the case where `breaking' is
	  set in the loop test (e.g., by the job control code when a job
	  is stopped with SIGTSTP), but the return value from the test is
	  something that would cause the loop to break.  Need to decrement
	  `breaking' in this case

				   7/10
				   ----
execute_cmd.c
	- in execute_in_subshell, make sure a command of type cm_subshell
	  inherits its `enclosing' command's CMD_IGNORE_RETURN flag

variables.c

	  exported functions in the export environment

pathexp.h,builtins/help.def
	- include <glob/strmatch.h>
	- fnmatch -> strmatch

execute_cmd.c
	- broke the code that parses the interpreter name from a #! line
	  out from execute_shell_script to a new function, getinterp()
	- call getinterp from execute_shell_script
	- use return value from getinterp in error message about bad
	  #! interpreter in shell_execve

				   7/12
				   ----
lib/readline/isearch.c
	- the last isearch string is now remembered in a new static variable,
	  last_isearch_string
	- if ^R^R is typed, readline now searches for the remembered isearch
	  string, if one exists

pcomplete.h
	- extern declaration for completions_to_stringlist()

	- make compgen return success only if sl->list_len is non-zero,
	  indicating that there are items on the list

				   7/31
				   ----
execute_cmd.c
	- in execute_connection, force stdin to /dev/null for asynchronous
	  commands if job control is not active, not just if the shell is
	  running a shell script (since you can run `set -m' in a script)

lib/readline/rltty.c
	- make sure _rl_tty_restore_signals resets `tty_sigs_disabled' on
	  successful restoration of the terminal modes
	- make sure _rl_tty_disable_signals turns off IXON so that ^S and
	  ^Q can be read by rl_quoted_insert

aclocal.m4
	- new check for FNM_EXTMATCH being defined in <fnmatch.h>, as Ullrich
	  Drepper intends to do for new versions of GNU libc

lib/sh/{strcasecmp,strtod,strtol}.c
	- don't pass possibly-negative characters to tolower() or toupper()

	- don't use local definitions of isblank, et al.; rely on macros
	  from <chartypes.h>

lib/readline/{display,readline}.c, mksyntax.c

{execute_cmd,subst}.c
	- change a couple of instances of ISDIGIT to DIGIT, where we really,
	  really only want ascii digits

ansi_stdlib.h
	- don't need a declaration for atol()

				   10/18
				   -----

aclocal.m4
	- new macro, BASH_FUNC_PRINTF_A_FORMAT, checks for printf support
	  for %a, %A conversion specifiers, defines HAVE_PRINTF_A_FORMAT
	  if successful

configure.in
	- call AC_CHECK_FUNCS for isascii
	- call BASH_FUNC_PRINTF_A_FORMAT

config.h.in
	- add a define for HAVE_ISASCII
	- add a define for HAVE_PRINTF_A_FORMAT

lib/sh/snprintf.c
	- for long double output, fall back to sprintf using ldfallback()
	  function for floating point formats
	- support %a, %A using dfallback() or ldfallback() if
	  HAVE_PRINTF_A_FORMAT is defined
	- fix bug in vasprintf that returned wrong value in its first
	  argument if the buffer holding the result string got reallocated
	- fixed PUT_CHAR macro to increment the counter even if we've
	  exceeded the buffer size, for the return value from
	  vsnprintf/snprintf
	- fix vsnprintf_internal to not use counter < length as a loop

	  the return value from vsnprintf/snprintf)

builtins/printf.def
	- support %a, %A if HAVE_PRINTF_A_FORMAT is defined

include/typemax.h
	- new file, with the TYPE_MAXIMUM stuff that's duplicated in several
	  files in lib/sh

lib/sh/{fmtulong,strtol,snprintf}.c
	- include <typemax.h> instead of having the definitions in each file

lib/sh/Makefile.in

	  in chartypes.h

config.h.in
	- defines for HAVE_IS{ASCII,BLANK,GRAPH,PRINT,SPACE,XDIGIT}

include/chartypes.h, lib/glob/strmatch.c, lib/readline/chardefs.h
	- don't redefine some is* ctype macros/functions if HAVE_ISXXX is
	  defined (meaning that an appropriate function, but not a macro,
	  exists)

lib/sh/strtrans.c
	- new function, ansic_shouldquote, returns 1 if argument string
	  contains non-printing chars that should be quoted with $'...'

externs.h
	- new declaration for ansic_shouldquote()

variables.c
	- change print_var_value to ansi C quote the string if we're not in
	  posix mode and the variable's value contains non-printing chars,
	  to use the regular shell single quoting if the value contains
	  shell meta-characters, and to just output the string otherwise

lib/sh/shquote.c
	- add `break' to `case '~':' to avoid fallthrough and extra test

doc/bashref.texi
	- note that in POSIX mode, `set' displays variable values that
	  include nonprinting characters without quoting, unless they
	  contain shell metacharacters

builtins/printf.def, lib/sh/snprintf.c
	- handle `F' conversion specifier as equivalent to 'f'

parse.y, {nojobs,variables}.c
	- a couple of cleanups for when building a minimal configuration

nojobs.c
	- new function: stop_making_children(), just sets
	  already_making_children to 0 (like stop_pipeline)

subst.c
	- call stop_making_children from subst.c:command_substitute if
	  JOB_CONTROL is not defined.  This fixes the bug where the wrong
	  process is waited for (and its status returned) when using
	  command substitution in a null command in a shell function

builtins/printf.def
	- new variable `tw' used to keep track of the total number of
	  characters written by a single call to `printf' -- to be
	  used for the `%n' conversion, which will be added later.  It
	  gets reset each time we reuse the format string, which is what
	  ksh93 seems to do

variables.c
	- new function, bind_var_to_int (char *var, long val)

variables.h
	- extern declaration for bind_var_to_int

{builtins,lib/{glob,sh}}/Makefile.in
	- append ${DEBUG} to LOCAL_CFLAGS value, passed by top-level Makefile

builtins/printf.def
	- added support for %n format conversion char (number of chars printed
	  so far from current format string)

				   10/24
				   -----
variables.c
	- if posixly_correct is set, the default value of $MAILCHECK is 600
	- use legal_number instead of atoi in adjust_shell_level

	- new function, init_funcname_var; sets FUNCNAME as a dynamic variable
	  if it's not set in the initial environment
	- new function, init_groups_var; sets GROUPS as a dynamic array
	  variable if it's not set in the initial environment
	- new function, init_dirstack_var; sets DIRSTACK as a dynamic array
	  variable if it's not set in the initial environment
	- new function, init_seconds_var; sets SECONDS as a dynamic
	  variable using any valid integer value in the initial environment
	  as the initial value, as if an assignment had been performed
	- call init_funcname_var, init_groups_var, init_dirstack_var,
	  init_seconds_var from initialize_dynamic_variables
	- non-numeric values assigned to LINENO are treated as 0
	- change initialize_shell_variables to not auto-export PATH or TERM
	- change set_home_var to not auto-export HOME
	- change set_shell_var to not auto-export SHELL
	- broke the code that sets HOSTNAME, HOSTTYPE, MACHTYPE, OSTYPE
	  out into a separate function, set_machine_vars; none of those
	  variables are auto-exported
	- bash no longer un-exports SSH_CLIENT or SSH2_CLIENT

shell.c
	- changed isnetconn() to check SSH_CLIENT and SSH2_CLIENT only if
	  SSH_SOURCE_BASHRC is defined in config-top.h

config-top.h
	- added a commented-out definition for SSH_SOURCE_BASHRC

				   10/25

				   -----
locale.c
	- fixed an `=' vs. `==' typo in set_locale_var when parsing
	  LC_NUMERIC

doc/builtins.1
	- some updates

builtins/psize.sh
	- some mktemp(1) changes

lib/readline/readline.c
	- change rl_backward to check for rl_point < 0 and reset to 0 if so

	- don't compile in _rl_strpbrk if HAVE_STRPBRK is defined

lib/readline/rlprivate.h
	- remove extern declaration of _rl_strpbrk

builtins/common.c
lib/sh/pathcanon.c
	- a few changes as the result of `gcc -Wall' patches from solar
	  designer

builtins/read.def, parse.y
	- change some calls to free() to xfree()

builtins/set.def
	- make sure unset_builtin() resets unset_array to 0 each time through
	  the loop, because it's set (and used) depending on the current
	  argument

shell.h
	- new define, USE_VAR, to force the compiler to not put a particular
	  variable in a register -- helpful if registers are not restored
	  by setjmp/longjmp

builtins/{evalfile.c,{read,wait}.def}, {eval,execute_cmd,shell,test}.c
	- use USE_VAR for some variables

subst.c
	- fixed a case in expand_word_internal where a NULL pointer could
	  have been passed to free() (though free() should ignore it)
	- fixed a case at the end of expand_word_internal where LIST could
	  have been used uninitialized (it makes gcc happy, though it
	  doesn't happen in practice)

test.c
	- give test_syntax_error(), beyond(), and integer_expected_error()
	  the `__noreturn__' attribute for gcc

unwind_prot.c
	- in clear_unwind_protect_list(), convert `flags' to `long' (via
	  assignment to a `long' variable) before casting to `char *', in
	  case pointers and longs are 64 bits and ints are 32 (makes no
	  difference on 32-bit machines)

				   10/30
				   -----
print_cmd.c
	- fixed cprintf to avoid gcc warning about assigning const pointer
	  to non-const (discarding type qualifier)

{make_cmd,pcomplete,test}.c,parse.y

lib/sh/tmpfile.c
	- fixed sh_mktmpfp to avoid file descriptor leaks in the case that
	  sh_mktmpfd succeeds but fdopen fails for some reason
	- change sh_mktmpfd to use the same scheme for computing `filenum'
	  as sh_mktmpname
	- change get_sys_tmpdir to prefer P_tmpdir if P_tmpdir is defined
	- changed sh_mktmpname and sh_mktmpfd to avoid trying to assign to
	  `nameroot' if `nameroot == 0' (duh)
	- add code to sh_mktmpfd to use mkstemp(3) if USE_MKSTEMP is defined
	- add code to sh_mktmpname to use mktemp(3) if USE_MKTEMP is defined

support/{fixlinks,mkclone}
	- use mktemp if it's available for the symlink test
	- use $TMPDIR instead of hardcoding /tmp; default to /tmp
	- use a better filename for the symlink test instead of `z'

support/bashbug.sh
	- more changes inspired by a patch from solar designer

lib/malloc/Makefile.in
	- new target `alloca', which builds libmalloc.a with alloca.o only
	  (for systems without alloca that are configured --without-bash-malloc)

configure.in
	- if we don't have a working alloca and are not configured to build
	  the bash malloc library, make a malloc library containing only
	  alloca.o

aclocal.m4
	- slight change to RL_LIB_READLINE_VERSION to deal with minor version
	  numbers with a letter appended (like 4.2a)

				   10/31
				   -----
doc/{bash.1,bashref.texi}
	- slight change to note that only interactive shells resend a SIGHUP
	  to all jobs before exiting

externs.h
	- declare strto[ui]max only if NEED_STRTOIMAX_DECL is defined.  This
	  keeps picky compilers from choking because intmax_t is not defined
	  (MacOS X 10.1)

builtins/printf.def
	- #define NEED_STRTOIMAX_DECL before including shell.h

				   11/1
				   ----
general.c
	- check in bash_tilde_expand() for an unquoted tilde-prefix; don't
	  bother passing the string to tilde_expand unless the prefix is

shell.c
	- fix a problem with $LINENO when executing commands supplied with
	  the -c invocation option when ONESHOT is defined

[bash-2.05a-rc1 frozen]

builtins/printf.def
	- fix the %n conversion to require that the variable name supplied
	  be a valid shell identifier

variables.c
	- improve random number generator slightly by using the upper 16
	  bits of the running random number instead of the lower 16, which
	  are incrementally more random

				   11/2
				   ----
configure.in
	- if RL_INCLUDEDIR ends up being /usr/include, don't put
	  -I$(RL_INCLUDEDIR) into CFLAGS

				   11/5
				   ----
doc/{bash.1,bashref.texi}
	- correct description of POSIXLY_CORRECT to note that the shell enters
	  posix mode *before* the startup files are read if POSIXLY_CORRECT
	  is in the initial environment

variables.c
	- fix function prologues for init_dirstack_var and init_groups_var
	  to agree with caller (no arguments)

jobs.c
	- fix forward function declarations for pipe_read and pipe_close

subst.c
	- removed `inline' attribute from skip_double_quoted because it can
	  potentially be called recursively

bashline.c
	- quick fix to bashline.c:attempt_shell_completion programmable
	  completion code to just punt if the end of the command word found
	  by find_cmd_end is <= the start found by find_cmd_start (the bug
	  is probably in find_cmd_start -- fix later)

pcomplete.c
	- fix gen_matches_from_itemlist to return if the stringlist is null
	  after any cleaning or initialization, before trying to use it
	- fix GEN_COMPS to only bother to try to append the STRINGLIST
	  returned by gen_matches_from_itemlist to `glist' if it's non-NULL

lib/sh/stringlist.c
	- make copy_stringlist return NULL if the STRINGLIST * passed as an
	  argument is NULL
	- make append_stringlist call copy_stringlist only if M2 is non-NULL;
	  otherwise just return NULL if m1 is NULL
	- make word_list_to_stringlist return 0 immediately if the passed
	  LIST argument is NULL
	- make realloc_stringlist call alloc_stringlist if the passed
	  STRINGLIST argument (`sl') is 0, just like realloc calls malloc

subst.c
	- in skip_to_delim(), if we have an unclosed ${, and it's at the end
	  of the string (string[i] == '{', string[i+1] == '{' and
	  string[i+2] == 0, return si (i +2) immediately without bothering
	  to call extract_dollar_brace_string or extract_delimited_string
	- in skip_to_delim(), if string[i] is 0 after a call to
	  extract_dollar_brace_string or extract_delimited_string (meaning we
	  have an unclosed ${ or other expansion, return i immediately without
	  doing a `continue' (which will increment i past the end of string)
	- in split_at_delims, don't increment te by 1 if it's pointing to a
	  delimiter.  this has the effect of skipping the first delimiter
	  char in a possibly multi-character delimiter, and ignoring
	  single-char delimiters like `>'

configure.in
	- use AC_CHECK_MEMBERS([struct stat.st_blocks]) instead of a call to
	  AC_STRUCT_ST_BLOCKS to avoid configure changing LIBOBJS if the test
	  fails

general.c
	- introduce two new variables: bash_tilde_{prefixes,suffixes}, set
	  to the additional prefixes and suffixes bash wants to pass to the
	  tilde expansion code (reserved for post-bash-2.05a fix)

aclocal.m4
	- add missing `test' in BASH_CHECK_SYS_SIGLIST

				   11/7
				   ----
lib/readline/vi_mode.c
	- fix rl_vi_goto_mark to explicitly check that the desired mark is
	  between 'a' and 'z', since some locales have lowercase letters
	  outside that range, which could cause a negative subscript

include/chartypes.h
	- remove superfluous `#undef ISASCII'

lib/sh/strto[iu]max.c
	- changes from Paul Eggert to work around buggy compilers and catch
	  configuration errors at compile time

aclocal.m4
	- new macro, BASH_C_LONG_DOUBLE, identical to AC_C_LONG_DOUBLE but
	  with a fix for Irix 5.3 (not called, since I'm not sure it's the
	  right thing to do -- the C standard allows double and long double
	  to be the same size)

lib/sh/snprintf.c
	- only try to write the trailing NUL in vsnprintf_internal if
	  data->length is >= 0, since if it's not, we probably don't have
	  a buffer

Makefile.in
	- changed RELSTATUS to `release'

				   11/8
				   ----
lib/sh/strtol.c
	- make sure chars passed to toupper are cast to unsigned

unwind_prot.c
	- change clear_unwind_protect_list to not require a cast from `int'
	  to `char *'

lib/readline/chardefs.h
	- make _rl_digit_p succeed only for ascii digits, since that's what
	  most callers assume

				   11/13
				   -----
doc/bashref.texi
	- added `ERR' trap and [-+]O invocation option to section listing
	  differences from the Bourne shell

				   11/15
				   -----
[bash-2.05a released]

				   11/19
				   -----
include/stdc.h
	- new define, INLINE, defined as `inline' for gcc and empty otherwise

subst.c
	- make skip_double_quoted, sub_append_string have INLINE attribute

trap.c
	- use BASH_NSIG as upper limit for signal names in signal_name()

lib/readline/bind.c
	- use RL_COMMENT_BEGIN_DEFAULT in output for rl-comment-begin value

error.c
	- fix sys_error to save value of errno around calls to fprintf

doc/Makefile.in
	- added rules to create PDF files from postscript and dvi input

MANIFEST.doc
	- added {article,bash,bashref,rose94}.pdf

doc/bash.1
	- rearranged some `.PD 0' and `.TP' directives so man2html will
	  handle them better (shouldn't affect groff output)

support/man2html.c
	- small fix to handle quoted string arguments to directives like
	  `.BR' without mangling the output

				   11/20
				   -----
{arrayfunc,variables}.c
	- changed calling sequence for dynamic array variable `assign'
	  functions to (SHELL_VAR *self, char *value, arrayind_t ind)
	- changed calling sequence for dynamic variable assign functions
	  to the same as array variable assign_func.  Now this can be
	  prototyped

variables.h
	- the assign_func member of a `struct variable' is now of type
	  `sh_var_assign_func_t', which is prototyped
	- the dynamic_value member of a `struct variable' is now of type
	  `sh_var_value_func_t', which is prototyped

variables.c
	- changed to use `sh_var_assign_func_t' and `sh_var_value_func_t'

builtins/cd.def
	- when in posix mode, if the new directory name formed by PWD and
	  the argument passed by the user cannot be canonicalized, and the
	  -P option has not been supplied, return failure immediately
	- if canonicalization failed, but the fallback to the directory
	  name specified by the user succeeds, reset the current working
	  directory

lib/readline/{input.c,rlprivate.h}
	- renamed rl_unget_char to _rl_unget_char; made library global

lib/readline/{{bind,readline}.c,{keymaps,rlprivate}.h}
	- support for `key subsequences'; allows a key sequence and a function
	  mapped to a subsequence of that key sequence.  Primarily to allow
	  arrow keys to be bound in readline vi insert mode, while preserving
	  the ESC function to switch to command mode.

lib/readline/{input.c,rlprivate.h}
	- new function, _rl_input_queued(T), does a check with select or
	  FIONREAD with a timeout of `T' (which is generally 0)

lib/readline/readline.c
	- change _rl_dispatch_subseq to test for input in the queue if we
	  get ESC while in vi insertion mode if the keymap entry type for
	  ESC is ISKMAP.  If _rl_input_queued returns non-zero, we assume
	  that an arrow key sequence has been pressed and go ahead with the
	  subsequence.  If it returns zero, we assume that the user pressed
	  ESC to switch into command mode, and dispatch to that right away.
	  This avoids forcing the user to press another key before switching
	  into command mode

				   11/21
				   -----
lib/readline/readline.c
	- bind common arrow key sequences in vi insertion keymap

lib/readline/terminal.c
	- bind termcap definition's arrow keys in vi insertion keymap

lib/readline/bind.c
	- check for rl_vi_movement_mode in _rl_bind_if_unbound, so
	  binding the arrow keys can work

lib/readline/readline.c
	- since _rl_bind_if_unbound does the check of what's currently
	  bound to the key sequence, the check in bind_arrow_keys_internal
	  was redundant
	- bind_arrow_keys_internal now takes a Keymap argument and handles
	  saving and restoring _rl_keymap; changed bind_arrow_keys
	  accordingly

builtins/fc.def
	- fix from Paul Eggert to substitute the nearest history number in
	  range if an out-of-range value is supplied.  POSIX requires this

lib/sh/pathcanon.c
	- fix from Corrina Vinschen for the special `cygdrive' prefix on
	  Cygwin

bashhist.c
	- split the history adding code into more pieces:
	    check_history_control (char *line) checks LINE against the value
	    of HISTCONTROL, returning 1 if LINE should be saved and 0 if not

	    check_add_history (char *line) calls check_history_control and
	    history_should_ignore (line) and saves the line with
	    bash_add_history if the checks indicate that it should be saved

	    maybe_add_history just calls check_add_history to set the value
	    of first_line_saved

bashhist.h
	- extern declaration for check_add_history()

shell.c
	- don't call load_history() from the interactive shell startup
	  code if history_lines_this_session is > 0, indicating that we've
	  already saved some lines in the history and that we probably
	  don't want to overwrite them

builtins/history.def
	- call check_add_history from push_history, so `history -s xx'
	  works even when in a compound command whose first line has not
	  been saved.  (Caveat:  in a compound command when the first
	  line has been saved, the line supplied to history -s will become
	  part of the compound command's history entry.  Of course, the
	  delete_history call could remove the compound command from the
	  history entirely)

bashline.c
	- use sh_makepath instead of xmalloc/sprintf in
	  command_word_completion_function

lib/readline/complete.c
	- get_y_or_n now takes an int FOR_PAGER argument; caller changed
	  If FOR_PAGER is non-zero, get_y_or_n returns appropriate values
	  for a more-like pager:  `newline' or `return' return 2; `q' or
	  `Q' return 0
	- there is now a mini internal more-like pager for displaying a
	  list of completions that exceeds the screen height (new function
	  _rl_internal_pager, called from rl_display_match_list)

				   11/24
				   -----
command.h
	- new flag, W_TILDEEXP, says to do tilde expansion on an
	  assignment word

execute_cmd.c
	- fix_assignment_words now sets W_TILDEEXP for assignment word
	  arguments to `assignment builtins'

general.c
	- bash_tilde_expand now takes a second argument indicating whether
	  or not it's being invoked in an `assignment context'

general.h
	- change extern declaration for bash_tilde_expand

{bashline,execute_cmd,findcmd,general,variables}.c
builtins/evalfile.c
lib/sh/makepath.c
	- fix callers of bash_tilde_expand appropriately

subst.c
	- fix callers of bash_tilde_expansion appropriately
	- add (currently commented-out) code that would tilde expand assignment
	  statement arguments to assignment builtins (W_TILDEEXP flag set)
	  even when the shell is in posix mode

bashline.c
	- fix attempt_shell_completion to turn off
	  rl_filename_completion_desired when doing command name completion,
	  so no slash gets appended to the name if there happens to be a
	  directory with the same name in the current directory

				   11/26
				   -----
lib/readline/rltech.texinfo
	- a couple of additions to the rl_stuff_char description

parse.y
	- turn off echo_input_at_read in parse_string_to_word_list, so `set -v'
	  doesn't give extra lines of output when doing compound array
	  assignment

subst.c
	- fix split_at_delims to handle skipping over a `\n' if it's a
	  delimiter (use spctabnl(c) instead of whitespace(c))

				   11/27
				   -----
support/config.{guess,sub}
	- updated (with bash changes) to latest version from gnu.org

sig.h
	- add prototype for set_signal_handler declaration

builtins/setattr.def
	- add prototype to extern declaration of declare_builtin

builtins/times.def
	- add no_options call, since times takes no options

lib/sh/spell.c
	- add prototypes to forward declarations for midist and spdist

lib/sh/strtrans.c
	- add explicit int return type to ansic_shouldquote declaration

lib/readline/rldefs.h, lib/readline/{macro,readline,util,undo}.c
	- move define for SWAP to rldefs.h, removed from various C files

lib/readline/vi_mode.c
	- removed define for exchange(), changed to use SWAP instead

lib/readline/bind.c
	- added some static forward function declarations
	- find_boolean_var, find_string_var now take a `const char *' argument

lib/readline/signals.c
	- added static forward declaration for rl_maybe_set_sighandler

lib/readline/readline.c
	- add some common key bindings for the HOME and END keys in
	  bind_arrow_keys_internal

lib/readline/terminal.c
	- fetch the `@7' termcap string; it's sent by the END key
	- attempt to bind the terminal's END key to rl_end_of_line in
	  bind_termcap_arrow_keys; I don't know why I was using `kH'
	  instead of `@7'

doc/builtins.1
	- remove `case', `for', `if', `until', `while' from NAME section;
	  those are not shell builtins

				   11/28
				   -----
stringlib.c
	- new function, find_token_in_alist, takes a token value and an
	  ALIST argument, and returns the string correspoinding to the
	  token if found in the alist

externs.h
	- new extern declaration for find_token_in_alist()

subst.c
	- string_list_internal is no longer static

subst.h
	- new extern declaration for string_list_internal()

parse.y
	- new alist array of other tokens returned by read_token which are
	  not reserved words in word_token_alist[]
	- reworked error reporting:  new functions print_offending_line,
	  which prints the line containing the syntax error,
	  error_token_from_token, which takes the current token and tries to
	  figure out its textual representation, and error_token_from_text,
	  which does the old job of finding the bad token by analyzing the
	  text of shell_input_line at the current index
	- report_syntax_error now tries to figure out the token that caused
	  the syntax error by first looking at current_token and falling
	  back to the old method of textual analysis if that fails
	- report_syntax_error doesn't say the token resulting from the textual
	  analysis of the input line is an `unexpected token'; it just
	  says there is a `syntax error near xxx'
	- changed conditional command error reporting to use the value
	  returned by error_token_from_token if it's not null instead of
	  just using the token value in the message, since current_token
	  ends up being set to -1, and the text of the message from
	  report_syntax_error might not be exactly right
	- change parse_string_to_word_list to set current_token to the
	  offending token returned by read_token before calling yyerror()
	  to make the error reporting do the right thing

aclocal.m4
	- fixed typo in BASH_CHECK_LIB_TERMCAP

configure.in
	- add check for isinf(3); define HAVE_ISINF_IN_LIBC if found

config.h.in
	- add define for HAVE_ISINF_IN_LIBC

lib/sh/snprintf.c
	- check for Inf and NaN, using isinf and isnan if they're found in
	  libc
	- use the current locale for thousands separator and decimal point
	- recognize "'" flag; not implemented yet
	- fix for snprintf/vsnprintf with length of 0 and string argument of
	  0 with non-zero length

builtins/read.def
	- TMOUT is now the default timeout for `read' (and select) if set,
	  like ksh93 when reading from the terminal
	- edit_line (called by read -e) now just does readline's filename
	  completion by setting rl_attempted_completion_function to NULL,
	  since e.g., doing command completion for the first word on the
	  line wasn't really useful

execute_cmd.c
	- changed select_command to return failure status if select_query
	  returns NULL, indicating that read_builtin returned
	  EXECUTION_FAILURE

doc/{bash.1,bashref.texi}
	- documented new TMOUT behavior 
	- slight change to the description of the test `-ef' option

doc/bashref.texi
	- added item to posix mode section describing failure behavior of
	  cd when invoked in logical mode and the pathname formed by
	  combining $PWD and the directory argument does not refer to an
	  existing directory

				   11/29
				   -----
execute_cmd.c
	- fix execute_function to call dispose_function_env after
	  merge_function_env if the shell is in posix mode (fixes debian
	  bash bug #117673)

lib/readline/readline.c
	- rl_forward -> rl_forward_char; rl_forward function for compatibility
	- rl_backward -> rl_backward_char; rl_forward function for
	  compatibility
	- new functions, rl_forward_byte, rl_backward_byte, for future use

lib/readline/readline.h
	- extern declarations for rl_forward_char, rl_backward_char,
	  rl_forward_byte, rl_backward_byte

lib/readline/{emacs_keymap,funmap,vi_keymap,vi_mode
	- rl_forward -> rl_forward_char
	- rl_backward -> rl_backward_char

lib/readline/funmap.c
	- new bindable names, `backward-byte' and `forward-byte'

aclocal.m4
	- new function, BASH_CHECK_MULTIBYTE, encapsulates checks for
	  multibyte code

config.h.in
	- add necessary defines for multibyte include files and functions

configure.in
	- add call to BASH_CHECK_MULTIBYTE

config-bot.h
	- add code to define HANDLE_MULTIBYTE if prerequisites are met

lib/sh/xstrchr.c
	- new file, xstrchr() is strchr(3) that handles multibyte characters

bashhist.c
	- first_line_saved -> current_command_first_line_saved; variable is
	  now global

bashhist.h
	- extern declaration for current_command_first_line_saved

				   11/30
				   -----
bashhist.c
	- break the code that actually calls add_history out of
	  bash_add_history into a new function, really_add_history;
	  bash_add_history now calls really_add_history
	- check_add_history takes a second `force' argument telling it
	  whether to call bash_add_history (force == 0) or really_add_history
	  (force != 0)

builtins/history.def
	- in push_history, call delete_last_history if the current command
	  has more than one line, the first line was saved, and
	  command-oriented history is active.  This takes care of deleting
	  the right history element if `history -s' is used within a
	  compound or multiline command
	- in push_history, call check_add_history with second argument of 1
	  to skip check of current_command_line_count and add the arguments
	  to history -s as a single separate history entry

				   12/3
				   ----
lib/readline/complete.c
	- append a slash to completed names which are symlinks to directories
	  if the new variable _rl_complete_mark_symlink_dirs is non-zero

lib/readline/rlprivate.h
	- extern declaration for _rl_complete_mark_symlink_dirs

lib/readline/bind.c
	- new bindable variable, `mark-symlinked-directories', mirrors the
	  value of _rl_complete_mark_symlink_dirs

doc/bash.1, lib/readline/doc/{readline.3,rluser.texinfo}
	- documented new `mark-symlinked-directories' variable

				   12/4
				   ----
variables.[ch]
	- set_pipestatus_array now takes a second argument with the number
	  of processes in the array
	- changed set_pipestatus_array to just modify the value in place if
	  the existing array has one element and the new array has one
	  element, and to modify existing values in place if new array has
	  more elements than existing array

variables.c, jobs.c
	- changed set_pipestatus_array callers

jobs.c
	- moved call to setjstatus() from set_job_status_and_cleanup to
	  wait_for, since set_job_status_and_cleanup is part of the SIGCHLD
	  signal handler call path, and race conditions accessing the
	  PIPESTATUS array will result for things like

		while true; do date; done | cat > /dev/null

				   12/5
				   ----
xmalloc.h
	- don't redefine xmalloc, xrealloc, and xfree if DISABLE_MALLOC_WRAPPERS
	  is #defined

config.h.in
	- #undef for DISABLE_MALLOC_WRAPPERS

configure.in
	- define DISABLE_MALLOC_WRAPPERS if the --with-purify option is
	  supplied

lib/malloc/trace.c
	- new function, malloc_trace_bin(N), traces allocations and frees
	  to bucket N (uses the same type of bitmap as `busy')

lib/malloc/table.c
	- fix wraparound search problem in find_entry when searching for a
	  free entry when the table is full

				   12/6
				   ----
lib/malloc/table.c
	- keep an `overflow bucket' around to use when the table is full,
	  so find_entry always returns a valid pointer when FIND_ALLOC
	  is set
	- new static variable to keep a count of the number of MT_ALLOC
	  entries in the mem_table

lib/sh/{oslib,clktck}.c
	- if HAVE_LIMITS_H is defined, include <limits.h>

lib/sh/oslib.c
	- new function, getmaxgroups() returns max number of simultaneous
	  groups
	- new function, getmaxchild(), returns max number of simultaneous
	  user processes

general.c
	- removed forest of #defines for getmaxgroups()

externs.h
	- new extern declaration for getmaxgroups()
	- new extern declaration for getmaxchild()
	- new extern declaration for isnetconn()

lib/sh/netconn.c,shell.c
	- new file, isnetconn() from shell.c moved here

Makefile.in, lib/sh/Makefile.in
	- necessary changes for netconn.c

builtins/ulimit.def
	- changed getmaxuprc() to just call getmaxchild() and massage the
	  return value appropriately

{jobs,nojobs}.c
	- use the value returned by getmaxchild() in
	  mark_dead_jobs_as_notified instead of static CHILD_MAX

jobs.c
	- new function, compact_jobs_list, removes some number of jobs from
	  the jobs table and reallocates the table, copying the jobs that
	  are left from the old table to the new.  Compaction happens from
	  the beginning of the list and removes dead jobs, and we make sure
	  to keep the last CHILD_MAX jobs as POSIX.2 requires
	- call compact_jobs_list from stop_pipeline if we're in a subshell,
	  there are no free jobs in the jobs table, and the jobs table is
	  at or above some maximum limit

execute_cmd.c
	- change eval_arith_for_expr to set this_command_name to `((' before
	  calling evalexp, since it might be changed by evaluating the
	  loop body between evalexp calls

trap.c
	- change reset_signal to turn off the SIG_TRAPPED flag for the
	  given signal, so shell builtins and functions running in command
	  substitutions don't run the signal handlers (traps are not supposed
	  to be inherited by command substitutions)

parse.y
	- changed parse_string_to_word_list to turn off alias expansion
	  while parsing the array assignment

				   12/9
				   ----
alias.c
	- fix add_alias so that redefining an alias's value also resets the
	  EXPANDNEXT flag

				   12/10
				   -----
parse.y
	- new function, token_is_assignment, called to check whether the text
	  before `=' makes up a valid assignment token before trying to parse
	  a compound assignment statement
	- new function, parse_compound_assignment, to parse a compound
	  assignment statement instead of using parse_matched_pair; handles
	  comments and error reporting in the parser instead of waiting until
	  expansion time
	- changed parse_compound_assignment and parse_string_to_word_list to
	  allow reserved words in compound array assignments

lib/readline/doc/rltech.texinfo
	- changed the documentation for rl_callback_read_char and
	  rl_callback_handler_remove to say what happens to the terminal
	  settings and what needs to be done to reset them

				   12/11
				   -----
bashline.c
	- add emacs_edit_and_execute_command, bound to C-xC-e, like vi-mode
	  `v' command
	- add bindable command name `edit-and-execute-command', bound to
	  run emacs_edit_and_execute_command()

lib/glob/strmatch.c
	- add support for ksh93-like [:word:] character class (isalnum + `_')

doc/{bash.1,bashref.texi}
	- add note to section describing lists to clarify that a sequence of
	  one or more newlines may be used to delimit a command, equivalent
	  to a semicolon
	- document new [:word:] pattern matching character class

doc/bash.1, lib/readline/doc/rluser.texinfo
	- document `edit-and-execute-command' and its default emacs-mode
	  binding

include/chartypes.h
	- add defines for TOCTRL and UNCTRL if they're not already defined

lib/readline/chardefs.h
	- #undef UNCTRL if it's defined to avoid cpp redefinition warnings

lib/sh/strtrans.c
	- add \cX (Control-X) escape for $'...' to ansicstr()
	- change ansic_quote() to allocate at least four chars for each char
	  in the string argument, to account for \0xx octal values
	- change ansic_quote() to no longer call sprintf for non-printable
	  characters; just translate the string to octal directly

print_cmd.c
	- change xtrace_print_word_list to call ansic_quote() if
	  ansic_shouldquote() indicates that there are nonprinting characters
	  in a word

builtins/type.def
	- changed deprecated long option parsing to just replace the word
	  in the list with the equivalent short option (-type -> -t) instead
	  of removing words from the list
	- changed describe_command to take a single flags argument instead
	  of two int args; changed caller
	- type now has two new options:  -f suppresses function lookup (like
	  command), and -P forces a PATH search for the name(s)

builtins/common.h
	- flags for describe_command are here
	- changed extern declaration of describe_command

builtins/command.def
	- changed call to describe_command to use flags from common.h, and
	  the right number of arguments

doc/{bash.1,bashref.texi}
	- documented new -f and -P options to `type'

				   12/12
				   -----
lib/readline/rldefs.h
	- fixed prototype for _rl_strnicmp

execute_cmd.c
	- select_query now takes a new argument, an int flag saying whether
	  or not to print the menu the first time through the loop.  An
	  empty line in response to the prompt will always cause the menu
	  to be reprinted
	- changed execute_select_command to cause select_query to reprint
	  the menu only if REPLY is set to NULL, if KSH_COMPATIBLE_SELECT
	  is defined

config-top.h
	- define KSH_COMPATIBLE_SELECT, with a comment about its meaning

lib/readline/readline.c
	- change rl_insert_comment to toggle if given an explicit numeric
	  argument:  if the first characters on the line don't specify a
	  comment, insert one; if they do, delete the comment text

doc/bash.1, lib/readline/doc/{readline.3,rluser.texinfo}
	- documented new behavior of insert-comment with a numeric argument

lib/malloc/watch.c
	- new file, implements watchpoint functions

lib/malloc/watch.h
	- new file, define some `events' for watchpoints and extern function
	  and variable declarations for watchpoint code

lib/malloc/imalloc.h
	- #define MALLOC_WATCH if MALLOC_DEBUG is defined
	- add __P define as in include/stdc.h if not already defined

lib/malloc/malloc.c
	- remove __P define, now in imalloc.h
	- include watch.h if MALLOC_WATCH is defined
	- added calls to _malloc_ckwatch in internal_malloc, internal_free,
	  and internal_realloc

include/stdc.h
	- augment __P define to allow prototypes if PROTOTYPES is defined

lib/readline/rlstdc.h
	- augment PARAMS define to allow prototypes if PROTOTYPES is defined

lib/malloc/Makefile.in, Makefile.in
	necessary changes to include watch.c in libmalloc

lib/readline/readline.c
	- fix rl_delete_text to make sure that the starting position is >= 0
	- _rl_init_line_state (called by readline via readline_initialize)
	  now sets rl_mark to 0
	- rl_get_{next,previous}_history set rl_mark to 0 if rl_point is at
	  the end of the line and rl_end otherwise in emacs mode

lib/readline/kill.c
	- rl_yank_nth_arg_internal and rl_paste_clipboard now set the mark
	  at point before calling rl_insert_text, like rl_yank
	- rl_kill_full_line now resets rl_mark to 0
	- rl_kill_line and rl_backward_kill_line now set rl_mark to the
	  point after the kill in emacs mode
	- rl_kill_word and rl_backward_kill_word now set rl_mark to the
	  point after the kill in emacs mode
	- rl_unix_word_rubout and rl_unix_line_discard now set rl_mark to
	  the point after the kill in emacs mode

lib/readline/search.c
	- noninc_search saves and restores the mark, since it can be changed
	  while reading the search string
	- noninc_dosearch sets the mark at the end of the line, making the
	  region bound the `inserted' text since rl_point is set to 0
	- rl_history_search_internal sets the mark at the end of the line,
	  for the same reason

lib/readline/isearch.c
	- rl_search_history now saves and restores the mark
	- if no matching lines are found at all when doing an isearch, leave
	  point where it was instead of moving it to the end of the line

				   12/17
				   -----
lib/readline/rlmbutil.h
	- new file, place for multi-byte character defines and extern
	  declarations

lib/readline/{bind.c,readline.c,rlprivate.h}
	- new bindable variable, `byte-oriented', tracks value of
	  rl_byte_oriented variable

	- include posixtime.h for time() extern declaration

support/bashversion.c
	- include <unistd.h> if it's available

lib/readline/{histexpand,input,isearch,search}.c
	- new code for multibyte characters, derived from IBM patch

lib/readline/readline.h
	- include rltypedefs.h

				   12/19
				   -----
lib/readline/complete.c
	- slight change to mark-directories code to avoid adding a slash if
	  point is at the end of the line (rl_line_buffer[rl_point] == '\0')
	  and the previous character was a slash
	- change printable_part to not return empty pathnames, which could
	  happen when completing filenames and a filename with a trailing
	  slash was passed as the argument.  If the portion following the
	  trailing slash is NULL, ignore it and look for a previous slash.
	  If there's no previous slash, just return the filename argument
	- new variable, rl_completion_mark_symlink_dirs, mirrors the value
	  of (user-settable with a variable) _rl_complete_mark_symlink_dirs
	  but may be modified by application-specific completion functions
	  when appropriate (set in rl_complete_internal and rl_menu_complete)

lib/readline/readline.h
	- extern declaration for rl_completion_mark_symlink_dirs

pcomplete.c
	- if one of the actions is CA_DIRECTORY, set
	  rl_completion_mark_symlink_dirs to indicate that we want the
	  trailing slash (might have to relax this)

lib/readline/doc/rltech.texinfo
	- documented rl_completion_mark_symlink_dirs variable

lib/readline/doc/rluser.texinfo, doc/bash.1
	- documented the fact that `complete -d' and `complete -o dirnames'
	  force readline to append a slash to symlinks to directories

builtins/enable.def
	- changed enable_shell_builtin to disallow enabling disabled
	  builtins in a restricted shell

doc/{bash.1,bashref.texi}
	- documented new enable behavior in restricted shells

doc/Makefile.in
	- new rule to make an `RBASH' file documenting the restrictions
	  imposed by a restricted shell

expr.c
	- broke the code that evaluates variables and returns results out
	  of readtok() into a new function: expr_streval()
	- expr_streval() now performs the standard unset variable error
	  behavior if `set -u' has been executed and it's asked to look
	  up an unset variable
	- broke the code that frees up the expression context stack into
	  a new function: expr_unwind()

variables.c
	- fixed bind_int_variable so it handles array element assignment,
	  so expressions like `b[7]++' and `b[0] = 42' work right
	- new function, get_variable_value, returns the string value of
	  the SHELL_VAR * passed as an argument
	- get_string_value now calls get_variable_value with a non-null
	  result from find_variable

				   12/20
				   -----
lib/readline/rlmbutil.h, mbutil.c
	- combined _rl_find_next_mbchar and _rl_find_next_nonzero_mbchar into
	  a single function
	- combined _rl_find_prev_mbchar and _rl_find_prev_nonzero_mbchar into
	  a single function

lib/readline/{display,readline,vi_mode}.c
	- changed callers of _rl_find_next_mbchar and
	  _rl_find_next_nonzero_mbchar

lib/readline/{complete,display,histexpand,readline,vi_mode}.c
	- changed callers of _rl_find_prev_mbchar and
	  _rl_find_prev_nonzero_mbchar

				   12/20

externs.h
	- provide an extern declaration for strftime if HAVE_STRFTIME is
	  not defined and NEED_STRFTIME_DECL is

lib/tilde/tilde.h
	- header files should not include <config.h>

parse.y
	- replace code in decode_prompt_string that chops up value returned
	  by ctime(3) with calls to strftime -- as a result, the expansion
	  of \@ has changed slightly (since it depends on the locale)
	- added new \D{format} prompt string escape; `format' is passed to
	  strftime(3).  Empty format is the same as `%X' (locale-specific
	  representation of the current time)
	- combined cases for '\\', '\a', '\e', and '\r' in same case branch
	  in decode_prompt_string

doc/{bash.1,bashref.texi}
	- documented new \D{format} prompt string expansion

builtins/printf.def
	- use ISO C PRIdMAX instead of INTMAX_CONV
	- pass length of format modifiers to mklong instead of computing it
	  with strlen()

lib/sh/{fmtulong,fmtullong}.c
	- changes from Paul Eggert to make more general

arrayfunc.c
	- when converting a variable to an array, make sure to unset the
	  dynamic_value and assign_func members of the struct variable,
	  since they're not valid anymore

				   12/27
				   -----
configure.in
	- use AC_HELP_STRING in AC_ARG_WITH and AC_ARG_ENABLE 
	- remove AC_ARG_ENABLE for largefile, since AC_SYS_LARGEFILE adds
	  one

				 1/2/2002
				 --------
{alias,bashline,execute_cmd,general,shell,subst,variables,arrayfunc}.c,general.h
	- changed some calls to strchr to calls to xstrchr for multibyte
	  characters

include/shmbutil.h
	- add extern declaration for xstrchr to avoid including externs.h
	  where it's not appropriate

{braces,make_cmd,pathexp,subst,arrayfunc}.c, lib/sh/xstrchr.c
	- include shmbutil.h

{stringlib,subst}.c, {externs,subst}.h
	- moved substring() from subst.c to stringlib.c, moved declaration
	  from subst.h to externs.h

lib/sh/xmbsrtowcs.c
	- new file, replacement function for mbsrtowcs

lib/sh/Makefile.in
	- add entries for xmbsrtowcs.c

Makefile.in
	- add dependencies on shmbutil.h to appropriate object files

lib/glob/strmatch.c
	- break character-class testing out into separate function:
	  is_cclass, in prep for multibyte changes

{braces,make_cmd}.c
	- changes for multibyte characters

builtins/printf.def
	- changes from Paul Eggert to just use intmax_t everywhere an
	  int/long/quad is needed and print with "%ld" if the number
	  fits in a long and %PRIdMAX otherwise
	- remove getlong, getulong, getllong, getullong, since they're
	  no longer needed
	- use a new type `floatmax_t' to print floating point numbers, the
	  widest-available floating point type (like `intmax_t'); new
	  function `getfloatmax' that calls strtold or strtod as appropriate
	- remove getdouble, getldouble, since they're no longer needed

lib/sh/fmtumax.c
	- new file, string-to-[u]intmax_t conversion, just includes
	  fmtulong.c with the right defines

Makefile.in, lib/sh/Makefile.in
	- additions for fmtumax.c

bashtypes.h
	- include <inttypes.h> if it's available

expr.c
	- arithmetic is now in intmax_t instead of long

externs.h
	- extern declaration for fmtumax
	- change extern declarations for evalexp, itos, inttostr,
	  uitos, uinttostr since they now return or use intmax_t instead
	  of long

{execute_cmd,general,mailcheck,subst,variables}.c, parse.y
{array,general,subst,test,variables}.h
lib/sh/{itos,netopen}.c
builtins/{bashgetopt,common}.c, builtins/common.h

	- changes for intmax_t shell arithmetic conversion

doc/{bashref.texi,bash.1}
	- documented long->intmax_t shell arithmetic conversion

sig.c
	- in initialize_terminating_signals, if we've already trapped a

				    1/3
				    ---
{arrayfunc,pathexp}.c, parse.y
	- changes for multibyte chars

parse.y, lib/sh/strtrans.c
	- moved ansiexpand from parse.y to lib/sh/strtrans.c

parse.y, locale.c
	- moved mk_msgstr and localeexpand from parse.y to locale.c

parse.y
	- new function, yy_input_name, returns name of input file from
	  bash_input.name
	- broke the code that parses ((...)) constructs out of read_token
	  into a new function, parse_dparen()

externs.h
	- new extern declaration for ansiexpand(), mk_msgstr(), and
	  localeexpand()

input.h
	- new extern declaration for yy_input_name()

{error,locale}.c
	- use yy_input_name for error and other messages

execute_cmd.c
	- change shell_execve to make sure that the file is executable
	  before looking at the interpreter to find out why the execve()
	  failed (avoids misleading error message)

lib/glob/glob.c
	- move code that matches leading `.' and skips those filenames into
	  a separate function: skipname(), so there can be unibyte and
	  multibyte versions of that function

				    1/7
				    ---
subst.c
	- more changes for multibyte characters

print_cmd.c
	- change semicolon() so it doesn't output a `;' immediately after a
	  newline, since that results in a null command, which is a syntax
	  error

variables.c
	- fix indirection_level_string to turn off set -x while evaluating
	  PS4

				    1/8
				    ---
builtins/set.def
	- make -o options into one struct, instead of separate structs for
	  option names corresponding to flags and non-flag option names.
	  This has the side effect of sorting the option names in output

lib/glob/glob.c
	- new function, mbskipname(), multibyte char version of skipname()
	- removed all #ifndef SHELL code, this will never be used outside
	  the shell

include/posixdir.h

				    1/9
				    ---
lib/glob/smatch.c
	- new file, with strmatch (now xstrmatch) and associated functions,
	  with changes for multibyte chars

lib/glob/sm_loop.c
	- new file, included by smatch.c, with `generic' versions of matching
	  functions that are compiled twice:  once each for single-byte and
	  multibyte characters

lib/glob/strmatch.c
	- strip out everything except strmatch(), which either calls fnmatch
	  (if HAVE_LIBC_FNM_EXTMATCH is defined) or xstrmatch

lib/glob/collsyms.c
	- changes for multibyte chars

lib/glob/Makefile.in, Makefile.in
	- changes for new source files

				   1/10
				   ----
lib/readline/complete.c
	- new function, rl_completion_mode (rl_command_func_t *func), returns
	  the appropriate value to pass to rl_complete_internal depending on
	  FUNC and the value of `show-all-if-ambiguous'.  This allows
	  application completion functions to present the same interface as
	  rl_complete

lib/readline/readline.h
	- new extern declaration for rl_completion_mode()

lib/readline/doc/rltech.texinfo
	- documented rl_completion_mode

lib/readline/readline.[ch]
	- bumped the version number to 4.3, changing the relevant cpp defines

configure.in
	- require that an installed readline version be at least readline-4.3

bashline.c
	- converted bash-specific completion functions to use
	  rl_completion_mode instead of passing TAB unconditionally

builtins/bashgetopt.c
	- the `#' option specifier now means a required numeric argument,
	  not an optional one

builtins/type.def
	- when converting [-]-{path,type,all} to -[pta], don't bother
	  freeing and reallocating the option string; just change opt[1]
	  and null opt[2]

lib/sh/snprintf.c
	- support %ls/%S and %lc/%C for wide strings and characters,
	  respectively, if HANDLE_MULTIBYTE is defined

mailcheck.c
	- don't print a message about new mail if the file has not grown,
	  even if the access time is less than the modification time

				   1/14
				   ----
lib/readline/readline.c
	- new function, rl_replace_line, to replace the readline line buffer
	  with the text supplied as an argument
	- new function, rl_replace_from_history, replaces readline line
	  buffer with text from history entry passed as argument (undocumented,
	  not in readline.h because it requires a definition of
	  HIST_ENTRY for the prototype)

lib/readline/readlne.h
	- new extern declaration for rl_replace_line

lib/readline/doc/rltech.texinfo
	- documented rl_replace_line

lib/readline/{isearch,readline,search}.c
	- use rl_replace_line and rl_replace_from_history where appropriate

lib/readline/readline.c
	- broke the code that sets point after moving through the history
	  (_rl_history_preserve_point and _rl_history_saved_point) out
	  into a separate function, _rl_history_set_point()

lib/readline/{complete.c,rlprivate.h}
	- find_completion_word -> _rl_find_completion_word
	- free_match_list -> _rl_free_match_list

lib/readline/complete.c
	- postprocess_matches and _rl_free_match_list now return immediately
	  if passed a null match list

variables.c
	- new function, find_local_variable, finds a local variable by name
	  at the current variable context
	- in find_variable_internal, call find_local_variable before searching
	  any of the temporary environments if variable_context > 0 (meaning
	  we're in a shell function).  This lets a local variable
	  override a variable whose value was passed in the `function
	  environment'

				   1/15
				   ----
variables.h, execute_cmd.c
	- declare variables describing the temporary environments in
	  variables.h instead of in C files

findcmd.c, builtins/setattr.def
	- instead of calling find_tempenv_variable, use find_variable_internal
	  and check whether the returned SHELL_VAR * has the tempvar
	  attribute

variables.c
	- tentative change to lookup order in find_variable_internal so that
	  function local variables are found before variables in
	  function_env when executing a shell function
	- change make_local_variable to handle making a local variable when
	  a variable with the same name already appears in one of the
	  temporary environments
	- broke the body of make_var_array out into a new function:
		static char **make_env_array_from_var_list (SHELL_VAR **vars)
	- new function, make_var_array_internal, takes a hash table to look
	  in and a pointer to a mapping function and returns a char **
	  environment-style list
	- make_var_array now just calls make_var_array_internal
	- new mapping function, local_and_exported, returns all local variables
	  in the current variable context with the export attribute set
	- new function, make_local_export_array, returns an environment-style
	  char ** array of exported local variables in current context
	- change environment creation order in maybe_make_export_env to
	  add variables to the environment in opposite order that
	  find_variable_internal uses.  This means that local variables in
	  shell functions override variables with the same name in the
	  function_env
	- change make_local_variable to set the initial value of the
	  variable it creates to NULL to make the `is set' and `is null'
	  tests that the expansion code does work right
	- change make_local_variable to inherit the value of a variable with
	  the same name from the temporary enviroment

				   1/16
				   ----
Makefile.in
	- link bashversion with buildversion.o instead of version.o, for
	  cross-compiling.  version.o is for the target system;
	  buildversion.o is for the build system

error.c
	- add line numbers to internal_error() messages if the shell is
	  not interactive and running a shell script or a -c command
	- report_error now prints non-zero line numbers for non-interactive
	  shells

test.c
	- test_syntax_error now calls builtin_error() instead of printing
	  its own messages

builtins/common.c
	- builtin_error now prints line numbers if a non-interactive shell
	  is running a shell script or a -c command

print_cmd.c
	- in cprintf, remove free_argp, since it's not used

builtins/history.def
	- make `history -n' increment the number of history lines in this
	  session by the number of lines read from the history file

arrayfunc.c
	- fix array_value_internal to expand the subscript even if the
	  variable is unset, so side effects produced by the arithmetic
	  evaluation will take place

lib/readline/doc/{rluser,rltech}.texinfo
	- some fixes for printing in @smallbook format from Brian
	  Youmans

				   1/17
				   ----
jobs.h
	- new PRUNNING, PSTOPPED, PDEADPROC defines for PROCESSes, analogous
	  to RUNNING, STOPPED, and DEADJOB defines for jobs

jobs.c
	- use PS_RUNNING, PS_DONE, PS_STOPPED values for `running' field
	  of a PROCESS
	- find_pipeline and find_job now take an additional flags argument
	  that, if non-zero, means to find only running processes; changed
	  all callers
	- changed calls to find_pipeline and find_job made from waitchld
	  to find only running processes
	- find_pipeline takes a third argument: an int *.  If it looks in
	  the jobs list to find the pid, and the arg is non-null, it passes
	  the job index back to the caller.  Used to avoid calls to
	  find_pipeline immediately followed by find_job with the same PID

nojobs.c
	- a couple of changes to make sure that set_pid_status is never
	  called with a pid argument of 0 or -1

trap.c
	- change trap_handler to longjmp to wait_intr_buf (set by wait_builtin)
	  if a signal is received for which a trap has been set during
	  execution of the wait builtin (need to include builtins.h and
	  builtins/builtext.h and declare some extern variables for the
	  right things to check)
	- new variable to keep track of which signal caused the longjmp to
	  wait_intr_buf, set by trap_handler (wait_signal_received)

builtins/wait.def
	- set the return value of wait when a longjmp(wait_intr_buf, 1) is
	  done to 128 + wait_signal_received

{jobs,nojobs}.c
	- set wait_signal_received to SIGINT in wait_sigint_handler before
	  the longjmp(wait_intr_buf, 1)

				   1/18
				   ----
bashline.c
	- turn off rl_filename_completion_desired when completing a command
	  name with a single match only if the first char of that match is
	  not a `/'
	- if there are multiple identical matches for a command name in
	  attempt_shell_completion, turn off rl_filename_completion_desired
	  if the first char is not a `/' to avoid readline appending a
	  slash if there's a directory with the same name in the current
	  directory

				   1/22
				   ----
lib/readline/complete.c
	- new variable, _rl_page_completions, to control whether we want to
	  run the internal pager when listing completions (defaults to 1)

lib/readline/rlprivate.h
	- extern declaration for _rl_page_completions

lib/readline/bind.c
	- new bindable variable, `page-completions', controls value of

lib/readline/terminal.c
	- fetch and save terminal's `vs' and `ve' cursor control attributes
	- fetch and save terminal's `kI' attribute (string sent by Insert)
	- new function, _rl_set_cursor, sets cursor to normal (insert mode)
	  or very visible (overwrite mode)

lib/readline/readline.c
	- new global variable, rl_insert_mode
	- new function to toggle overwrite mode, rl_overwrite_mode
	- each new line starts in insert mode
	- switching to vi mode or emacs mode resets to insert mode
	- reset cursor to normal before returning line
	- _rl_replace_text now returns the number of characters inserted,
	  the return value from rl_insert_text
	- new function, _rl_insert_or_replace_text (const char *string, int insert),
	  either inserts STRING or replaces the number of chars in STRING
	  with STRING starting at rl_point, depending on value of INSERT
	- renamed rl_insert to _rl_insert_char, rl_insert just calls
	  _rl_insert_char with the same arguments when in insert mode
	- new function, _rl_overwrite_char, handles self-insert in overwrite
	  mode.  Does multibyte chars by reading an entire multibyte character
	  before entering overwrite loop
	- new function, _rl_overwrite_rubout, handles RUBOUT when in
	  overwrite mode, called from rl_rubout
	- new function, _rl_rubout_char, old body of rl_rubout; rl_rubout
	  calls this when not in overwrite mode 

lib/readline/readline.h

	- new bindable name `overwrite-mode', bound to rl_overwrite_mode

lib/readline/rlconf.h
	- define CURSOR_MODE if you want the cursor to show insert or
	  overwrite mode (only available if both `vs' and `ve' capabilities
	  are present)

lib/readline/{complete,parens,readline,search,vi_mode}.c
	- change calls to rl_insert to _rl_insert_char

lib/readline/{readline,search}.c
	- change calls to rl_rubout to _rl_rubout_char to avoid overwrite
	  mode problems

lib/readline/vi_mode.c
	- fix rl_vi_overstrike to just call _rl_overwrite_char, which
	  handles multibyte chars

lib/readline/doc/{rluser.texinfo,readline.3}, doc/bash.1
	- document new `overwrite-mode' command

				   1/23
				   ----
lib/readline/readline.c
	- return 0 immediately from rl_insert_text if the string to insert
	  is NULL or ""

bashline.c
	- if a numeric argument is given to one of the bash-specific glob
	  pattern completion functions (including TAB), append a `*' to
	  the word before generating matches
	- in attempt_shell_completion, when doing glob completion, only
	  set the match list to NULL if rl_completion_type == TAB and
	  there is more than one completion.  This permits listing completions
	  with double tabs and displaying ambiguous completions
	- new function, bash_glob_complete_word, appends a `*' to the word
	  to be completed and then globs it.  It uses a new filename
	  quoting function (bash_glob_quote_filename) to avoid quoting
	  globbing characters in the filename if there are no matches or
	  multiple matches

lib/readline/complete.c
	- set completion_changed_buffer to 0 in rl_complete_internal if
	  no matches were produced by the completion generator function
	- new variable, rl_completion_suppress_append, suppresses appending
	  of rl_completion_append_character.  Settable by application
	  completion functions, always 0 when application completion
	  functions are called (set to 0 by rl_complete_internal and
	  rl_menu_complete)
	- broke the code that assigns default values to readline completion
	  variables out of rl_complete_internal and rl_menu_complete into
	  a new function, set_completion_defaults (int what_to_do)

lib/readline/readline.h
	- extern declaration for rl_completion_suppress_append

lib/readline/doc/rluser.texinfo, doc/bash.1
	- documented behavior of glob-expand-word and glob-list-expansions
	  when supplied a numeric argument
	- documented glob-complete-word

lib/readline/doc/rltech.texinfo
	- documented rl_completion_suppress_append

				   1/24
				   ----
lib/readline/text.c
	- new file, text and character handling functions from readline.c

lib/readline/misc.c
	- new file, miscellanous bindable functions and their supporting
	  code from readline.c

Makefile.in, lib/readline/Makefile.in
	- changes for text.c, misc.c

lib/readline/bind.c
	- change ISKMAP case of rl_invoking_keyseqs_in_map to output
	  ESC as "\M-" instead of "\e" -- it's closer to the documentation
	- change _rl_get_keyname to output ESC as \e instead of \C-[
	  (it's easier to understand)

pcomplete.h
	- new flag, COPT_NOSPACE

builtins/complete.def
	- new `-o nospace' option for complete and compgen (though it doesn't
	  really do anything for compgen, since that doesn't hand anything
	  off to readline)

bashline.c
	- if a programmable completion specifies COPT_NOSPACE, set
	  rl_completion_suppress_append = 1

lib/readline/doc/rluser.texinfo
	- documented new `-o nospace' option to complete and compgen

doc/{bash.1,bashref.texi}
	- documented $'\cX' escape sequence (forgot to before)

				   1/28
				   ----
variables.c
	- make_new_variable now takes the HASH_TABLE * as its second
	  argument; changed callers
	- new function, bind_variable_in_table, takes the HASH_TABLE * as
	  its third paramter; bind_variable calls bind_variable_in_table
	  with shell_variables as third argument

variables.h
	- new struct var_context, variable context (per-scope -- global,
	  function local, etc.)

variables.[ch],builtins/common.[ch]
	- moved functions that push and pop a variable context from
	  builtins/common.c to variables.c; move extern function
	  declarations to variables.h
	- new function, all_local_variables
	- variable_in_context is now static, used only by all_local_variables

variables.[ch],execute_cmd.c
	- push_context now takes the function name as an argument for
	  future use
	- push_context takes an indication of whether or not the function is
	  executing in a subshell and saves the positional parameters only
	  if not in a subshell
	- new functions for managing a stack of variable contexts and
	  scopes:  new_var_context, dispose_var_context, push_var_context,
	  pop_var_context, push_scope, pop_scope

builtins/declare.def
	- call all_local_variables instead of map_over (...) in declare_internal
	- don't call make_local_variable if we're looking at functions
	  ((flags_on & att_function) != 0), since it's wasted
	- make sure VAR is set to NULL if check for variable_context fails
	  and we didn't just create or fetch a local variable in
	  declare_internal
	- in non-function branch of declare_internal, only call find_variable
	  if VAR is NULL -- if it's not null, we just created or fetched a
	  local variable and don't need to do it again

				   1/29
				   ----
variables.[ch]
	- the temporary environments (temporary_env, builtin_env, function_env)
	  are now HASH_TABLEs instead of argv-style arrays of strings (this
	  is an intermediate step on the way to the new lcc-inspired symbol
	  table scope structure)
	- new internal attribute for variables: att_propagate.  This means
	  to propagate the value out of the temporary environment up the
	  (for now implicit) chain of variable scopes when the containing
	  temporary environment is deleted

variables.c
	- assign_in_env now adds to the HASH_TABLE temporary_env instead
	  of making environment-style strings in an array of strings
	- changed the way the temporary environments are merged into the
	  shell variable table to account for the new HASH_TABLE temp
	  environments
	- changed the way the export environment is created due to the new
	  structure of the temporary environments
	- new function, bind_variable_internal (name, value, table), binds
	  NAME to have VALUE in TABLE without searching the temporary
	  environments
	- removed: shell_var_from_env_string, bind_name_in_env_array
	- variable_in_context now checks the att_local attribute and makes
	  sure the variable is not invisible
	- local_and_exported now makes sure the variable is not invisible

execute_cmd.c
	- we no longer need to copy the temporary environment to function_env
	  or builtin_env, we can simply use variable assignments

{findcmd,subst,variables}.c, builtins/{declare,setattr}.def
	- since variables from the temporary environments are no longer turned
	  into SHELL_VARs on the fly, don't dispose the SHELL_VAR returned
	  by find_variable or find_variable_internal
	- need to savestring() the value returned by find_variable if it has
	  the tempvar attribute before calling bind_variable on it, because
	  bind_variable will search and bind into the temporary environments
	  and will free the old value before binding the new.  For temporary
	  environments, these two pointers will be the same, and
	  bind_tempenv_variable will end up using freed memory

builtins/{declare,setattr}.def
	- set the att_propagate attribute when exporting or making readonly
	  variables from the temp environment (i.e., `var=value declare -x var'
	  or `var=value export var' sets the propagate attribute on the entry
	  for `var' in the temporary environment HASH_TABLE)

lib/readline/isearch.c
	- ^W when reading isearch string yanks the current word out of the
	  current line into the search string, skipping the portion already
	  matched
	- ^Y when reading isearch string yanks the rest of the current line
	  into the search string, skipping the portion already matched

				   1/30

{print_cmd,variables}.c
	- moved indirection_level_string() from variables.c to print_cmd.c

{externs,variables}.h
	- moved extern declaration of indirection_level_string to externs.h

{general,variables}.c
	- moved assignment() from variables.c to general.c

{general,variables}.h
	- moved extern declaration of assignment() to general.h

{externs,input}.h
	- moved extern declaration of decode_prompt_string to externs.h

print_cmd.c
	- include flags.h, don't include stdc.h

variables.c
	- moved some functions around to group functions better
	- changed new_shell_variable to explicitly initialize each member
	  of the created struct variable instead of calling bzero()
	- make_new_variable now just calls new_shell_variable instead
	  of duplicating what it does
	- removed some code in bind_function that duplicated what
	  new_variable does on the newly-created SHELL_VAR
	- since there are no local function variables (functions are always
	  made at the global scope), kill_all_local_variables() doesn't
	  need to consider functions

				   1/31
				   ----
variables.c
	- sort the array of special variables
	- short-circuit the search in stupidly_hack_special_variables if
	  the passed name can't be found in the rest of the array
	  (that is, if name[0] < special_vars[i].name[0])

lib/readline/history.c
	- unstifle_history() was returning values exactly opposite of
	  the documentation

lib/readline/doc/{hsuser.texinfo,history.3}
	- clarified the unstifle_history() documentation a little

				    2/4
				    ---
variables.c
	- in bind_variable, don't call bind_tempenv_variable after a
	  find_tempenv_variable succeeds -- just change the value inline.
	  There's no reason to look it up twice
	- change makunbound to only call stupidly_hack_special_variables
	  if we're not unsetting a function

variables.[ch]
	- new function, unbind_function, like makunbound but doesn't mess
	  with previous contexts or calling stupidly_hack_special_variables

builtins/set.def
	- change unset_builtin to call either unbind_func or unbind_variable

builtins/getopts.def
	- call unbind_variable(name) instead of makunbound(name, shell_variables)

				    2/5
				    ---
lib/glob/sm_loop.c
	- use malloc instead of xmalloc in BRACKMATCH and handle failures

error.c
	- add extern declaration of executing_line_number with prototype,
	  since execute_cmd.h can't be included without including other
	  files

lib/readline/parens.c
	- include <unistd.h>

lib/malloc/stats.c
	- include <unistd.h>
	- add extern declaration of malloc_free_blocks() with prototype

pathexp.c
	- added some forward declarations with prototypes for static functions

lib/readline/rlprivate.h
	- removed declarations of rl_untranslate_keyseq, rl_discard_argument,
	  rl_stop_output, rl_alphabetic since they appear in readline.h

				    2/6
				    ---
{arrayfunc,execute_cmd,pcomplete,shell}.c
	- change calls to makunbound(name, shell_variables) to
	  unbind_variable (name)

				    2/7
				    ---
builtins/getopt.c
	- don't defer incrementing of OPTIND when an invalid option is
	  encountered until the next call to sh_getopt() -- what if OPTIND
	  is reset before that next call?  This means that OPTIND is always
	  incremented to the next option to be handled when an option is
	  returned, whether it's valid or not.  This is what POSIX-2002
	  says to do.

syntax.h
	- new #define, CSUBSTOP

mksyntax.c
	- add "-=?+" with value CSUBSTOP to the syntax table.  These are the
	  valid expansion operators OP in ${param[:]OPword}

subst.c
	- use table lookup for CSUBSTOP in VALID_PARAM_EXPAND_CHAR
	- new flags for the string extraction functions:  EX_NOALLOC.  This
	  indicates that the functions are being used only to skip over
	  strings and the result won't be used, so the substring shouldn't
	  be allocated, copied, and freed
	- new flag for string_extract:  EX_VARNAME.  This serves the same
	  purpose as the old `varname' parameter.  parameter_brace_expand()
	  changed appropriately
	- extract_delimited_string and extract_dollar_brace_string now take
	  an additional `flags' argument, which may include EX_NOALLOC
	- changed callers of extract_delimited_string and
	  extract_dollar_brace_string appropriately
	- string_extract now understands EX_NOALLOC; callers changed
	- some smaller code cleanups
	- converted char_is_quoted(), unclosed_pair(), and skip_to_delim()
	  to understand multibyte characters

				   2/11
				   ----
variables.[ch]
	- moved to a symbol organization inspired by lcc.  The basic structure
	  is no longer a HASH_TABLE, but a VAR_CONTEXT, which includes a hash
	  table as one of its members.  VAR_CONTEXTs are linked together to do
	  variable scoping.  One nice thing about this is that the entire
	  symbol table doesn't need to be searched at function scope exit to
	  remove local variables.  Fixes problems with only one instance of
	  builtin_env and function_env, even though it really is a stack
	- shell_variables is now a VAR_CONTEXT *, with a global_variables
	  variable that points to the bottom of the stack for fast access
	- function-scope local variables (assignments specified on the command
	  line before a function call) and function-local variables (declared
	  with the `local' builtin) have been unified in the same variable
	  context, replacing function_env
	- assignment statements preceding the `.' and `eval' builtins are now
	  a separate variable scope VAR_CONTEXT, replacing builtin_env
	- temporary_env (a HASH_TABLE) is now the only separate environment
	- changes to export environment creation, variable binding, variable
	  lookup, local variable propagation all changed to work with the
	  new symbol table/scope structure
	- a SHELL_VAR no longer has a `prev_context' member; it's not needed

execute_cmd.c
	- changes to push_context calls to include any temporary variables in
	  temporary_env; pop_context takes care of propagating any temporary
	  variables if necessary
	- calls to push_scope if `eval' or `.' is called with a list of
	  preceding variable assignments, and pop_scope called at end of
	  builtin's execution.  pop_scope takes care of merging temporary
	  variables into the shell environment when appropriate

builtins/{setattr,declare}.def
	- changes to account for variable assignments preceding `local',
	  `export', `readonly', `declare', etc. to work with the new
	  variable scoping implementation

shell.c
	- since shell_variables is now a VAR_CONTEXT, call
	  delete_all_contexts() when the shell is reinitializing instead of
	  delete_all_variables()

builtins/common.c
	- new function, get_job_by_name(), used by execute_simple_command()
	  for the `auto_resume' stuff and get_job_spec()

builtins/common.h
	- new set of #defined constants for flags argument to
	  get_job_by_name()

				   2/12
				   ----
command.h
	- new redirection operator: r_reading_string for `here strings'

parse.y
	- new token, LESS_LESS_LESS, for new redirection `here string'
	  operator: [N]<<< word
	- recognize LESS_LESS_LESS and create the appropriate redirection

{dispose_cmd,copy_cmd,make_cmd,print_cmd}.c
	- recognize r_reading_string and do the right thing (dispose_redirects,
	  copy_redirect, print_redirection, and make_redirection, respectively)

redir.c
	- here_document_to_fd now takes the redirection operator as its
	  second argument
	- new function, write_here_string, expands a here string and writes it
	  to the here document file descriptor
	- here_document_to_fd calls write_here_string for r_reading_string
	  operator
	- handle r_reading_string in do_redirection_internal() and
	  stdin_redirection()

				   2/18
				   ----
doc/{bash.1,bashref.texi}
	- documented here strings

{configure,Makefile}.in
	- bumped version number up to bash-2.05b and the release status
	  to alpha1

expr.c
	- make expr_streval understand that variables with the `invisible'
	  attribute are really unset, and accessing such a variable when
	  `set -u' is set should be an error

variables.h
	- new accessor macros: var_isset(var) and var_isnull(var), test
	  whether var->value is NULL

{eval,subst,variables}.c, builtins/{declare,setattr}.def
	- be more consistent about using value_cell(var) instead of
	  directly referencing var->value
	- use var_isset and var_isnull where appropriate

builtins/help.def
	- augmented a couple of help strings with pointers to `info' and
	  `man -k'

				   2/14
				   ----
variables.h
	- new macros to use when setting variable values directly instead of
	  through bind_variable and its siblings

{arrayfunc,variables}.c
	- use var_setarray and other lvalue macros instead of assigning to
	  var->value directly

builtins/setattr.def
	- change show_var_attributes to show function definitions separately
	  from function attributes.  This allows the output of `declare -f'
	  (with other flags), `export -f', and `readonly -f' to be reused as
	  shell input, instead of the old

		declare -f[flags] func()
		{
			foo
		}

	  which has syntax errors.  When in posix mode, `export -fp' and
	  `readonly -fp' still don't print function definitions

lib/sh/memset.c
	- replacement function for memset(3)

lib/sh/Makefile.in, Makefile.in
	- additions for memset.c

configure.in,config.h.in
	- check for memset, define HAVE_MEMSET if found, add memset.o to
	  LIBOBJS if not

lib/malloc/malloc.c
	- removed zmemset(), replaced with calls to memset(3)

{subst,execute_cmd,lib/sh/netopen}.c
	- replaced calls to bzero with calls to memset

subst.c
	- word_split() now takes a second argument: the value of $IFS, so
	  it doesn't have to look up IFS every time
	- word_list_split() now calls getifs() and passes the result to
	  each call to word_split() as its second arg
	- do a quick scan for CTLNUL in remove_quoted_nulls before allocating
	  new string, copying old string to it, copying over original string
	  and freeing new string

eval.c
	- don't bother calling dispose_used_env_vars if temporary_env is NULL

execute_cmd.c
	- fix fix_assignment_words to only look up the builtin corresponding
	  to the first word if one of the words in the list is marked as
	  W_ASSIGNMENT

hashlib.c
	- renamed hash_string to hash_bucket, which better reflects what it
	  does
	- extracted the portion of hash_bucket that computes the hash out
	  into a new hash_string()
	- made new body of hash_bucket into a macro HASH_BUCKET; function
	  just calls the macro
	- calls to hash_bucket in this file now call HASH_BUCKET macro
	- in add_hash_item, just add a new item at the front of the appropriate
	  bucket list instead of at the end

hashcmd.h
	- reduced FILENAME_HASH_BUCKETS to 53 from 107

				   2/19
				   ----
hashlib.[ch]
	- find_hash_item, remove_hash_item, add_hash_item all take a new
	  third `flags' argument
	- add_hash_item doesn't call find_hash_item if HASH_NOSRCH passed in
	  flags arg
	- find_hash_item will create a new hash table entry if HASH_CREATE is
	  passed in flags arg
	- new function, hash_walk, takes a pointer to a function and a table
	  and calls the function for each item in the table.  If the function
	  returns < 0, the walk is terminated
	- fixed flush_hash_table to set table->nentries to 0 after freeing
	  all entries
	- BUCKET_CONTENTS now has a new `khash' member, what key hashes to;
	  set by HASH_BUCKET macro (which calls hash_string), assigned in
	  find_hash_item (HASH_CREATE) and add_hash_item
	- find_hash_item and remove_hash_item check `khash' against the
	  hash of the string argument before calling strcmp

{alias,hashlib,hashcmd,pcomplib,variables}.c
	- changed all calls to {find,remove,add}_hash_item

builtins/hash.def
	- return immediately from print_hashed_commands if there are no
	  entries in the hash table (this eliminates need for `any_printed'
	  variable)
	- change print_hashed_commands to use hash_walk

alias.c
	- short-circuit all_aliases and map_over_aliases if
	  HASH_ENTRIES(aliases) == 0
	- simplify map_over_aliases by just allocating enough room in the
	  returned list for all entries in the aliases hash table, instead
	  of doing the check and xrealloc
	- add_alias now calls add_hash_item with HASH_NOSRCH argument

pcomplete.h
	- sh_csprint_func_t is no more; use hash_wfunc instead

pcomplib.c
	- short-circuit print_all_compspecs if HASH_ENTRIES(prog_completes)
	  is 0
	- print_all_compspecs now takes a `hash_wfunc *' argument
	- print_all_compspecs now just calls hash_walk

builtins/complete.def
	- new function, print_compitem, takes a BUCKET_CONTENTS *, extracts
	  the right info, and calls print_one_completion

variables.c
	- short-circuit map_over_funcs if HASH_ENTRIES(shell_functions) == 0
	- short-circuit flatten if the passed table has no entries
	- bind_variable_internal takes a new fourth argument: `hflags',
	  to pass to hash table functions
	- make_new_variable now passes HASH_NOSRCH flag to add_hash_item
	- set_if_not now calls bind_variable_internal and passes
	  HASH_NOSRCH as flags argument
	- bind_function now calls add_hash_item with HASH_NOSRCH argument
	- fixed make_local_variable:  old_var == 0 && was_tmpvar can never
	  be true
	- if we didn't find an old variable in make_local_variable, call
	  bind_variable_internal with HASH_NOSRCH argument
	- fix push_temp_var to reset variable context to 0 if binding into
	  global_variables->table

parse.y
	- fix to parse_compound_assignment to avoid core dumps on empty
	  compound array assignments

subst.c
	- getifs() is now global so read_builtin can call it

subst.h
	- extern declaration for getifs()

				   2/20
				   ----
hashlib.c
	- changed hash_string to use a better hash function
	- changed HASH_BUCKET to use masking rather than modulus to hash a
	  string to a bucket -- HASH TABLES MUST NOW BE SIZED BY POWERS
	  OF TWO

hashlib.h
	- DEFAULT_HASH_BUCKETS is now 64

hashcmd.h
	- FILENAME_HASH_BUCKETS is now 64

pcomplib.c
	- COMPLETE_HASH_BUCKETS is now 32

variables.c
	- TEMPENV_HASH_BUCKETS is now 4

alias.c
	- new define, ALIAS_HASH_BUCKETS, set to 16, used to size alias table

hashlib.c
	- removed initialize_hash_table; folded code into make_hash_table
	- fixed copy_bucket_array to copy the `khash' member of an item
	- renamed functions to be more systematic and easier for me:
		make_hash_table -> hash_create
		hash_table_nentries -> hash_size
		copy_hash_table -> hash_copy
		find_hash_item -> hash_search
		remove_hash_item -> hash_remove
		add_hash_item -> hash_insert
		flush_hash_table -> hash_flush
		dispose_hash_table -> hash_dispose
		print_table_stats -> hash_pstats
		get_hash_bucket -> hash_items
	- changed hash_search to short-circuit if table->nentries == 0 and
	  HASH_CREATE has not been passed in the flags argument

{alias,variables,hashcmd,pcomplib}.c
	- renamed calls to all renamed functions from hashlib.c

builtins/kill.def
	- don't drop a leading `-' in a pid argument
	- call kill_pid with an explicit third argument of 1 if the pid
	  argument to kill is < -1, rather than rely on the behavior of

lib/readline/input.c
	- rl_gather_tyi is now an `int' valued function; returns the number
	  of characters read (0 or 1) or -1 on error
	- if rl_gather_tyi() returns -1 to rl_read_key(), set rl_done to 1
	  and return a newline; something is wrong with the input fd

				   2/25
				   ----
variables.[ch]
	- IFS is now a special variable
	- new special var function, sv_ifs(), called when IFS is set or unset
	- call setifs() when IFS is first set in initialize_shell_variables
	- call setifs() from make_local_variable and assign_in_env if
	  appropriate
	- if assign_in_env() is called with a var assignment like `VAR=',
	  make the value in the new SHELL_VAR created be "" like
	  do_assignment_internal does, since certain parts of the shell use
	  a NULL value as evidence that the variable is unset (though
	  attributes may have been assigned)
	- if push_temp_var pushes something up to the global_variables table,
	  make sure that the context is set to 0
	- new function dispose_temporary_env, called by both
	  dispose_used_env_vars and merge_temporary_env with different `free
	  func' function pointers; calls sv_ifs after disposing the temporary
	  environment
	- push_exported_var now calls bind_variable_internal instead of
	  bind_variable
	- pop_scope and pop_context now call sv_ifs

subst.[ch]
	- new global variables used to keep track of IFS state, to avoid
	  having to call find_variable("IFS") all the time:

		ifs_var		the SHELL_VAR for IFS
		ifs_value	ifs_var ? value_cell (ifs_var) : " \t\n"
		ifs_cmap	bitmap of characters in ifs_value
		ifs_firstc	first character in ifs_value

	- new function setifs(), sets the aforementioned ifs variables each
	  time IFS is set or unset, and at nested scope exit
	- instead of calling getifs() from inside subst.c, use ifs_value
	- getifs() now just returns ifs_value
	- use ifs_firstc in string_list_dollar_star()
	- only call member() in issep() if separators is more than one char
	- don't cache a bitmap every time expand_word_internal() is called;
	  use ifs_cmap instead
	- new macro, isifs(c), checks whether C is in ifs_cmap

builtins/read.def
	- use issep() and isifs() macros instead of looking at $IFS directly

syntax.h
	- make sure macros that access sh_syntaxtab cast the argument to
	  `unsigned char' before array access
	- new macros: issyntype(c, type) and notsyntype(c, type), check
	  sh_syntaxtab[c] for a particular flag value `type'

				   2/26
				   ----
hashlib.h
	- the `data' member of a `BUCKET_CONTENTS' is now a PTR_T

{hashlib,alias,variables,hashcmd,pcomplib}.c
	- removed some casts when assigning to and using `data' member of a
	  `BUCKET_CONTENTS'

subst.c
	- in split_at_delims, call make_word_list instead of allocating and
	  initializing a WORD_LIST * directly

make_cmd.[ch]
	- add_string_to_list is now just a macro that calls make_word_list
	- make_simple_command now calls make_word_list instead of allocating
	  a WORD_LIST * directly

				   2/27
				   ----
copy_cmd.c
	- copy_word now calls make_bare_word to allocate the copy
	- copy_word_list now calls make_word_list to allocate the copy

shell.h
	- include `ocache.h' for simple object caching
	- call cmd_init() to initialize the WORD_DESC and WORD_LIST object
	  caches

{make,dispose}_cmd.c
	- allocate WORD_DESC * and WORD_LIST * vars from their respective
	  ocaches, and return them to the cache when disposing

jobs.c
	- renamed old `waiting_for_job' variable to `queue_sigchld', which
	  better reflects its intent:  sigchld_handler does not call waitchld
	  if `queue_sigchld' is non-zero, it simply increments the count of
	  waiting children
	- cleanup_dead_jobs now just sets and clears queue_sigchld instead of
	  blocking and unblocking SIGCHLD; it calls waitchld at the end if
	  `sigchld' is non-zero, but that's not really necessary
	- in setjstatus, only call xrealloc if `statsize' is less than the
	  number of processes passed -- no reason to do it if they're the
	  same

				   2/28
				   ----
sig.[ch]
	- reinitialize_signals is no more; initialize_signals takes an
	  argument saying whether or not we are reinitializing

builtins/exec.def
	- reinitialize_signals() -> initialize_signals(1)

test.c
	- fix filecomp() to work right when one file has a non-positive
	  timestamp and the other file does not exist

doc/{bash.1,bashref.texi}
	- document what happens for test's -nt and -ot operators when one
	  file operand exists and the other does not

jobs.c
	- if we haven't messed with SIGTTOU, just manipulate queue_sigchld
	  in notify_of_job_status instead of calling sigprocmask()
	- list_one_job now calls pretty_print_job directly instead of going
	  through print_job
	- pretty_print_job now must be called with SIGCHLD blocked or held
	  instead of blocking SIGCHLD itself
	- changed start_job so that it doesn't call UNBLOCK_CHILD and then
	  immediately call BLOCK_CHILD again (explicitly or via last_pid()),
	  call find_last_pid instead of last_pid and then UNBLOCK_CHILD
	- changed wait_for_job the same way
	- find_last_pid now takes a second argument: block; uses BLOCK_CHILD
	  if `block' is 1, not otherwise.  Changed existing calls:
		find_last_pid(j) -> find_last_pid(j, 0)
		last_pid(j) -> find_last_pid(j, 1)
	  `last_pid()' is now gone
	- rewrote wait_for_background_pids(); it was a little strange
	
copy_cmd.c
	- copy_if_command: don't copy null false_case commands
	- copy_simple_command: don't copy a null redirection list

subst.c
	- in get_word_from_string and list_string, just check for " \t\n"
	  directly rather than calling strcmp
	- in get_word_from_string and strip_trailing_ifs_whitespace, use
	  isifs() instead of issep(), since they're never called with
	  separators != $IFS
	- change issep() to call isifs if separators is longer than one
	  character, since it's never called with anything but "", " ",
	  or $IFS

				    3/1
				    ---
sig.h
	- enclose the BLOCK_SIGNAL macro in a do {...} while (0) loop, at it
	  should have been all along

lib/readline/doc/rltech.texinfo
	- document that readline defaults to stdin/stdout if rl_instream/
	  rl_outstream are NULL

lib/readline/terminal.c
	- if an application is using a custom redisplay function,
	  rl_resize_terminal just calls rl_forced_update_display to tell
	  (*rl_redisplay_func) to update the display, otherwise call
	  _rl_redisplay_after_sigwinch

lib/readline/readline.c
	- change readline_internal_setup() so the change to vi insertion mode
	  happens even if readline_echoing_p is 0
	- don't print the prompt to rl_outstream in readline_internal_setup
	  if we're not echoing and the caller has defined a custom redisplay
	  function -- let the redisplay function deal with it

configure.in
	- new option: --enable-mem-scramble, controls memory scrambling on
	  free() (on by default; only affects use of bash malloc)

config.h.in
	- new option MEMSCRAMBLE, controlled by --enable-mem-scramble

				    3/5
				    ---
parse.y
	- added ksh-like behavior of [...] to read_token_word:  if a `[' is
	  seen in an assignment context and the previous characters in the
	  token form a valid identifier, parse the [...] with
	  parse_matched_pair to allow spaces (and newlines) in the subscript

bashline.c
	- new function bash_servicename_completion_function, for completing
	  service names from /etc/services

bashline.h
	- new extern declaration for bash_servicename_completion_function

builtins/complete.def
	- allow new `-s/-A service' option to complete and compgen builtins

pcomplete.h
	- new CA_SERVICE define, new ITEMLIST variable it_services

pcomplete.c
	- add callback to bash_servicename_completion_function to generate
	  list of matching service names for completion

doc/bash.1,lib/readline/doc/rluser.texinfo
	- documented new `-s/-A service' option to complete and compgen

				    3/6
				    ---
builtins/read.def
	- change hard-coded `0' to new variable `fd' (initially 0) in
	  preparation for adding `-u fd' option

bashline.c
	- bash_directory_completion_hook calls expand_prompt_string instead
	  of expand_string (it does the right thing).  This keeps expansion
	  errors from causing a longjmp, which shouldn't happen because of
	  completion
	- command_subst_completion_function was augmented very slightly to
	  do filename completion on a non-command-word in a command
	  substitution
	- command_subst_completion_function now skips over the lcd that
	  rl_completion_matches puts in matches[0] if there is more than
	  one possible completion

				    3/7
				    ---
builtins/read.def
	- only add the unwind_protect to free `rlbuf' if `edit' is non-zero,
	  since we won't be using readline otherwise

lib/sh/zread.c
	- renamed zread1 -> zreadintr

redir.c
	- small change to redirection_error() to make a slightly better
	  guess about the invalid file descriptor if the redirection op is
	  r_duplicating_input or r_duplicating_output

include/stdc.h
	- new macro, SH_VA_START, to encapsulate the difference between
	  stdarg va_start and varargs va_start

{error,pcomplete,print_cmd}.c,builtins/common.c,lib/sh/snprintf.c
	- use SH_VA_START

				    3/8
				    ---
builtins/read.def
	- support for the ksh-like `-u fd' option

general.c
	- new function sh_validfd(fd), returns 1 if fd is a valid open file
	  descriptor

general.h
	- extern decl for sh_validfd

bashline.c
	- don't call posix_readline_initialize() from initialize_readline();
	  sv_strict_posix() should already have taken care of it

				   3/11
				   ----
{error,pcomplete,print_cmd}.c, builtins/common.c
	- removed non-varargs versions of functions

builtins/printf.def
	- if the string argument to %q has non-printing characters, call
	  ansic_quote to quote it rather than sh_backslash_quote

variables.h
	- new attribute: att_trace (and corresponding trace_p() macro).
	  Functions with this attribute will inherit the DEBUG trap.
	  Currently ignored for variables

builtins/declare.def
	- new `-t' option to declare/typeset toggle the `att_trace' attribute

builtins/setattr.def
	- check for att_trace and output `-t' flag in show_var_attributes

execute_cmd.c
	- if a function is being traced (it has the `-t' attribute set),
	  don't turn off the DEBUG trap when it executes

doc/{bash.1,bashref.texi}
	- document the new `-t' option to declare/typeset

				   3/12
				   ----
execute_cmd.c
	- don't execute the debug trap in the `cm_simple:' case of
	  execute_command_internal; run it in execute_simple_command so we
	  get the line number information right when executing in a shell
	  function
	- run a DEBUG trap before executing ((...)) arithmetic commands,
	  like ksh93
	- run a DEBUG trap before executing [[...]] conditional commands,
	  like ksh93

eval.c
	- add a static forward declaration for alrm_catcher()

general.c
	- add static forward declarations for bash_special_tilde_expansions,
	  unquoted_tilde_word, initialize_group_array

config.h.in
	- add placeholder for HAVE_DECL_STRCPY define, set by configure

general.h
	- don't declare strcpy if HAVE_DECL_STRCPY is defined with a non-zero
	  value

sig.h
	- add prototype to typedef of SigHandler

lib/readline/histlib.h
	- removed extern declaration of strcpy()
	- include string.h/strings.h directly in histlib.h instead of source
	  files

lib/readline/{histexpand,histfile,history,histsearch}.c
	- don't include string.h/strings.h now that histlib.h includes it

lib/tilde/tilde.c
	- removed extern declaration of strcpy(), rely on string.h/strings.h

command.h
	- four new redirection types: r_move_input, r_move_output,
	  r_move_input_word, r_move_output_word, for
	  [N]<&word- and [N]>&word- from ksh93

print_cmd.c
	- changes to print r_move_input[_word] and r_move_output[_word]

copy_cmd.c
	- changes to copy r_move_input[_word] and r_move_output[_word]

dispose_cmd.c
	- changes to dispose r_move_input_word and r_move_output_word

make_cmd.c
	- changes to make r_move_input[_word] and r_move_output[_word] from
	  r_duplicating_{input,output}_word, which is how the new redirs
	  are passed by the parser

redir.c
	- changes to make r_move_input[_word] and r_move_output[_word] do
	  the right thing when executed

builtins/read.def
	- print an error message and return failure immediately if zread/zreadc
	  return < 0

doc/{bash.1,bashref.texi}
	- documented new [n]<&word- and [n]>&word- redirections

				   3/13
				   ----
lib/readline/isearch.c	
	- enabled code to allow chars bound to rl_rubout to delete characters
	  from the incremental search string

shell.c
	- add `-l' invocation option to parse_shell_options; equivalent to
	  `--login'
	- fixed set_login_shell to check first char of base pathname of argv0
	  for `-', like other shells
	- move the check for make_login_shell after the call to
	  parse_shell_options because the `-l' option might set it

doc/{bash.1,bashref.texi}
	- documented new `-l' invocation option

array.c
	- new function, array_shift, shifts an array left by a specified
	  number of elements
	- array_walk is now compiled in by default
	- array_to_assignment_string now takes a second argument: int quoted.
	  If non-zero, the result is single-quoted before being returned
	- quoted_array_assignment_string has been removed

array.[ch]
	- renamed most of the array functions so that all have an array_
	  prefix and are more systematically named
	- array_slice now preserves the indicies from the original array
	- change array_to_assign to use a static buffer for expanding the
	  array indices, instead of malloc/free

{arrayfunc,subst,variables}.c, builtins/read.def
	- changed calls to various array functions to use new names

lib/sh/stringvec.c, externs.h
	- renamed all of the functions to have a strvec_ prefix and to have
	  a more sensible name scheme
	- strvec_search's arguments are now supplied in reverse order, so
	  the char **array is first, like the other functions
	- new function, strvec_resize, xrealloc for strvecs

{alias,array,bracecomp,braces,bashline,execute_cmd,findcmd,general,pathexp,
pcomplete,variables}.c
lib/sh/stringlist.c
builtins/{bind,complete,exec,getopts,pushd,set}.def
	- change calls to all functions from lib/sh/stringvec.c
	- use strvec_resize where appropriate

externs.h
	- only declare dup2() if HAVE_DUP2 is undefined or DUP2_BROKEN is
	  defined

lib/readline/{macro,readline,util}.c, lib/readline/rlprivate.h
	- _rl_defining_kbd_macro is gone, use RL_ISSTATE(RL_STATE_MACRODEF)

lib/readline/readline.h
	- new struct readline_state, encapsulates most of readline's internal
	  state in case you need reentrancy or nested calls to readline()
	- extern declarations for rl_save_state, rl_restore_state

lib/readline/readline.c
	- add (undocumented) int rl_save_state (struct readline_state *),
	  int rl_restore_state (struct readline_state *)

				   3/14
				   ----
array.[ch]
	- new function, array_rshift, shifts an array right by a specified
	  number of elements, optionally inserting a new element 0

examples/bashdb/bashdb
	- new single-file version of bash debugger, originally modified from
	  version in bash-2.04 by Gary Vaughan (the old debugger still
	  appears in examples/obashdb).  This version has a more gdb-like
	  command set

examples/bashdb/bashdb.el
	- new emacs bashdb debugger mode from Masatake YAMATO <jet@gyve.org>

execute_cmd.c
	- don't make $LINENO relative to function start unless the shell is
	  currently interactive -- this is what ksh93 does and what I
	  believe to be the intent of POSIX.2 (this required changing some
	  of the test checks because the output has changed)
	- run the debug trap for each command in an arithmetic for expression,
	  like ksh93 does

lib/readline/vi_mode.c
	- redid rl_vi_subst (binding func for `s' and `S') in terms of
	  rl_vi_change_to:  `S' == `cc' and `s' == `c '.  This makes undo
	  work right

				   3/18
				   ----
hashlib.c
	- fixed hash_walk to return if the item function returns < 0, instead
	  of breaking out of the current hash chain

array.c
	- fixed array_walk to return if the item function returns < 0, like
	  hash_walk

lib/sh/stringlist.c, externs.h
	- new function: strlist_walk, takes a stringlist and a pointer to an
	  item func.  Like other _walk funcs, if item func returns < 0 the
	  walk is cancelled
	- new function: strlist_flush, frees items in the contained list
	  with strvec_flush
	- renamed functions to have a strlist_ prefix and be more systematic

pcomplib.c,pcomplete.h
	- removed redundant `progcomp_initialized' variable
	- renamed functions to have `progcomp_' or `compspec_' prefixes
	  like the hash library

{bashline,pcomplete}.c,builtins/complete.def
	- fixed calls to stringlist functions to use new names
	- fixed calls to functions in pcomplib.c to use new names

pcomplete.c
	- made the debugging code #ifdef DEBUG -- it should be mature enough

builtins/hash.def,parse.y
	- use REVERSE_LIST(x, t) instead of (t)reverse_list(x)

list.c,{externs,general}.h
	- renamed the list functions to have a list_ prefix, changed callers

externs.h,{execute_cmd,stringlib,subst}.c,builtins/common.c,lib/sh/stringvec.c
	- word_list_to_argv -> strvec_from_word_list
	- argv_to_word_list -> strvec_to_word_list
	- moved functions to lib/sh/stringvec.c

lib/sh/stringvec.c
	- changed name of second argument to strvec_from_word_list from `copy'
	  to `alloc' so the use of `copy' between strvec_from_word_list and
	  strvec_to_word_list isn't as confusing
	- changed name and sense of second argument to
	  strvec_to_word_list from `copy' to `alloc' for the same reason --
	  now both functions agree on semantics of second argument

lib/sh/stringlist.c
	- ditto for strlist_from_word_list and strlist_to_word_list

subst.c
	- changed callers of strvec_to_word_list

				   3/19
				   ----
builtins/hash.def
	- added `-l' option to list table or individual targets in reusable
	  format
	- added `-d' option to remove one or more names from the table of
	  hashed commands (provides `unhash' or `unalias -t' functionality)

doc/{bash.1,bashref.texi}
	- documented new `-l' and `-d' options to `hash'

hashcmd.[ch]
	- renamed functions to have a `phash_' prefix and follow new naming
	  convention
	- phash_remove now returns an int:  1 if command not in hash table,
	  0 if filename removed OK

{findcmd,variables}.c, builtins/{hash,type}.def
	- changed callers to use new names from hashcmd.c

builtins/common.[ch]
	- new function, sh_notfound(s), prints standard `not found' message

builtins/shopt.def
	- changed SHOPT_ERROR macro to shopt_error function

builtins/bind.def
	- regularized error messages to `bind: object: error string' like

builtins.h
	- the `short_doc' member of a `struct builtin' is now of type
	  `const char *'
	- the strings in `long_doc' array of a struct builtin are now const

builtins/mkbuiltins.c
	- changes for new `const' members of struct builtin

lib/readline/histfile.c
	- new file, with code to mmap the history file for reading and

error.[ch]
	- new function, err_badarraysub(s), calls report_error with standard

	- new function, sh_readonly, calls builtin_error with standard
	  `readonly variable' message

variables.c,builtins/declare.def
	- call sh_readonly where appropriate

lib/sh/stringvec.c
	- added strvec_remove (sv, s), removes S from SV and shuffles rest of
	  elements down 1

lib/sh/stringlist.c
	- added strlist_remove(sl, s), just calls strvec_remove on the
	  component list

externs.h
	- new extern declarations for strvec_remove and strlist_remove
	- fixed extern declaration for strvec_search; the arguments were
	  reversed (unimportant, it's not compiled into the shell)

subst.c
	- change param_expand to call quote_escapes on values retrieved when
	  expanding the positional parameters
	- change parameter_brace_expand_word to quote escapes on values
	  retrieved when expanding the positional parameters
	- fix parameter_brace_substring to quote escape characters on unquoted
	  substrings extracted from variable values (needed to separate case
	  VT_VARIABLE from VT_ARRAYMEMBER for this, since, because
	  get_var_and_type calls array_value for VT_ARRAYMEMBER, we need to
	  skip over quoted characters in an already-appropriately-quoted
	  string to find the substring we want)
	- fix parameter_brace_substring to quote escape characters in the
	  value returned by pos_params when expanding subsets of the
	  positional parameters and not within double quotes (in which case
	  pos_params() quotes the string for us)
	- fix parameter_brace_substring to quote escape characters in the
	  value returned by array_subrange when expanding subsets of an
	  array and not within double quotes (in which case
	  array_subrange() quotes the string for us)
	- new function, quoted_strlen(s), does strlen(s) while skipping over
	  characters quoted with CTLESC (#ifdef INCLUDE_UNUSED, since it's
	  not used yet)
	- changed pos_params() so it always returns a list whose members are
	  quoted strings if (quoted&(Q_HERE_DOCUMENT|Q_DOUBLE_QUOTES)) != 0

arrayfunc.c
	- fix array_value to consistently call quote_escapes, even when a
	  non-array variable is being subscripted with element 0, in which
	  case we return the variable value

lib/sh/strtrans.c
	- make the for_echo parameter to ansicstr a `flags' parameter that
	  has its old `for echo' meaning if flags&1 is non-zero (which is
	  consistent with the old code)
	- Added code to the `flags' parameter to ansicstr so that if flags&2
	  is non-zero, CTLESC and CTLNUL are escaped with CTLESC in the
	  expanded string
	- change ansiexpand() to call ansicstr with a `flags' parameter of 2

lib/readline/histfile.c

	- changed array_value_internal to take an additional `int *'
	  parameter, in which is returned the type of array indexing
	  performed (array[@] vs. array or array[index])
	- changed array_value and get_array_value to take a corresponding
	  extra parameter and pass it to array_value_internal
	- changed array_value_internal to no longer return newly-allocated
	  memory or quote CTLESC and CTLNUL in the returned string if
	  `simple' array indexing (subscript not `@' or `*') is being
	  performed.  This makes it more like a variable lookup

arrayfunc.h
	- changed prototypes for array_value and get_array_value

expr.c
	- added new parameter to call to get_array_value in expr_streval
	- don't need to free memory returned by get_array_value any more

subst.c
	- quote_escapes now works with multibyte characters
	- dequote_string now works with multibyte characters
	- dequote_escapes is now needed, so it's compiled in, and it
	  now works with multibyte characters
	- remove_quoted_escapes now just calls dequote_escapes and copies the
	  result over the argument string
	- remove_quoted_nulls now returns its char * argument, parallels
	  remove_quoted_escapes
	- parameter_brace_expand_word now passes the new argument to
	  array_value and quotes CTLESC and CTLNUL in the result if it's a
	  `simple' array expansion by calling quote_escapes
	- get_var_and_type now returns VT_ARRAYMEMBER for references like
	  ${array} where `array' is an array variable (just like ${array[0]}).
	  Documented (in comment) that a VT_VARIABLE return value means that
	  quote_escapes has been called at some point
	- changed callers of get_var_and_type to no longer free value if
	  VT_ARRAYMEMBER is returned as type
	- changed parameter_brace_substring and parameter_brace_patsub to
	  call dequote_escapes on the value from get_var_and_type if the
	  type is VT_VARIABLE, since the substring and pattern substitution
	  code doesn't understand CTLESC quoting
	- parameter_brace_substring no longer needs to call quoted_substring
	  for the VT_ARRAYMEMBER case
	- changed parameter_brace_patsub to call quote_escapes on the result
	  of pat_subst for the VT_VARIABLE and VT_ARRAYMEMBER cases, and to
	  quote the returned string in the VT_ARRAYVAR and VT_POSPARAMS cases
	  if the `MATCH_QUOTED' flag isn't set (if it is, the pattern
	  substitution functions perform any necessary quoting)
	- quoted_substring is no longer used; it's now #ifdef INCLUDE_UNUSED

lib/malloc/mstats.h
	- new member in _malstats: u_bits32_t bytesreq, the total number of
	  bytes requested by the caller via calls to malloc() and realloc()

lib/malloc/stats.c
	- print bytesreq member in _print_malloc_stats
	- don't print statistics for buckets for which nmal == 0 (no mallocs)

lib/malloc/malloc.c
	- modified internal_malloc, internal_realloc to keep running total of
	  number of bytes requested by calling application

shell.c
	- sh_exit is now compiled in; exit_shell calls sh_exit

error.c
	- changed fatal_error, report_error, parser_error to call sh_exit

				   3/28
				   ----
subst.[ch]
	- changed Q_NOQUOTE to Q_PATQUOTE; it makes the intent more clear

subst.c
	- moved code from parameter_brace_expand into a new function that
	  dispatches for pattern substitution: parameter_brace_remove_pattern
	- changed structure of parameter_brace_remove_pattern to be like
	  parameter_brace_patsub and its ilk:  call get_var_and_type to
	  isolate the variable name, move the pattern isolation code out of
	  the various *_remove_pattern functions into
	  parameter_brace_remove_pattern and pass the results to the various
	  functions, use a switch on the return value from get_var_and_type
	  to decide which function to call, regularized the arguments to the
	  separate pattern removal functions
	- parameter_brace_remove_pattern now properly quotes escape chars in
	  the returned value
	- changed get_var_and_type to call dequote_escapes on the `value'
	  parameter for case VT_VARIABLE and return the result in *valp,
	  so the calling functions don't have to do it themselves; changed
	  callers appropriately
	- fixed getpattern() where it broke posix compliance:  if you enclose
	  a pattern removal spec in double quotes, the outer double quotes
	  have no effect on the pattern (POSIX.1-200x 2.6.2).  This uncovered
	  a bug in the test suite (!)

pathexp.c
	- fixed a problem with quote_string_for_globbing where it would change
	  consecutive CTLESC chars all to \ instead of changing every other
	  quoted char

				   3/31
				   ----
lib/malloc/{malloc,stats}.c
	- moved declaration of _mstats to malloc.c so stats.o doesn't get
	  linked into the shell if the stats functions aren't called

				    4/2
				    ---
lib/glob/smatch.c
	- introduce `XCHAR' define, which is the type of arguments passed to
	  strcoll/strcmp/strlen and their wide-character equivalents, added
	  appropriate casts
	- static arrays in single-byte version of rangecmp() are `char', not
	  `unsigned char', so compilers don't complain about calls to strcoll

lib/glob/sm_loop.c
	- casts for `XCHAR' and `XCHAR *' arguments to libc functions
	- use prototype declaration for BRACKMATCH if `PROTOTYPES' is defined
	  to avoid problems with type promotion (unsigned char -> int)

lib/glob/collsyms.h
	- `name' member of struct _COLLSYM is now of type `XCHAR *', since
	  some compilers don't like `unsigned char *' initializers from
	  constant strings

[bash-2.05b-alpha1 released]

builtins/{evalstring.c,common.h}
	- new flag for parse_and_execute, SEVAL_NOFREE, means to not free
	  the argument string when finished

lib/readline/text.c
	- fixed a trivial typo in _rl_insert_char when reading multibyte
	  char sequences
	- replace calls to ding() with rl_ding()

lib/readline/display.c
	- fixes from Jiro SEKIBA <jir@yamato.ibm.com> to fix autowrapping
	  when using multibyte characters

lib/glob/sm_loop.c
	- fixed a problem in BRACKMATCH where not enough memory was allocated
	  to hold a multibyte character when parsing POSIX.2 char class names

support/config.{guess,sub}
	- updated via patch from Paul Eggert with latest GNU additions

variables.c
	- var_lookup should use its `vcontext' argument instead of
	  unconditionally using `shell_variables'

				    4/4
				    ---
builtins/bind.def,doc/{bash.1,bashref.texi}
	- changed the usage summary and help text to make it clear that any
	  readline command that may appear in ~/.inputrc may be supplied as
	  one of the non-option arguments to `bind'

builtins/mkbuiltins.c
	- added support for `-H' option, which means to write long documentation
	  for each builtin to a separate file in the `helpfiles' directory

builtins/Makefile.in
	- new target `helpdoc', just creates long doc files in helpfiles
	  directory

lib/sh/zcatfd.c
	- new file, with zcatfd(int fd, int ofd, char *fn); dumps data from
	  FD to OFD

Makefile.in,lib/sh/Makefile.in
	- added zcatfd.c, zcatfd.o member of libsh.a

builtins/evalstring.c
	- changed cat_file to call zcatfd(fd, 1, fn)

builtins/{shopt,colon}.def
	- removed the $DOCNAME directive for `shopt', `true', and `false';
	  just use the names
	- changed $DOCNAME for `:' to just be `colon' instead of
	  `colon_builtin'

builtins/reserved.def
	- added help entries for ((, [[, `for (('

builtins/let.def
	- add id++, id--, ++id, --id, ** to help text

				    4/8
				    ---
builtins/bashgetopt.[ch]
	- changed to allow options beginning with `+', enabled by a leading
	  `+' in the option string
	- new variable, list_opttype, set to `-' or `+'

builtins/{common.c,{builtin,eval,exit,fg_bg,let,printf,pushd,return,source,wait}.def
	- changes to allow a `--' option for every builtin that accepts
	  operands but not options, as per posix.1-2001

builtins/{declare,setattr}.def
	- use internal_getopt for parsing options, now that it supports `+'

builtins/set.def
	- use internal_getopt for initial option parse, now that it supports
	  a leading `+'


{configure,Makefile}.in, builtins/{Makefile.in,help.def,mkbuiltins.c}
	- support for a new configure option, ``--enable-separate-helpfiles'',
	  moves the `long' help text to separate help files, installed by
	  default into ${datadir}/bash, one file per builtin.  Off by
	  default -- it saves 47K, but it's only 47K, and it's in the text
	  segment

flags.c
	- build internal_getopt() option string argument from flags array at
	  runtime in shell.c

shell.c
	- new variable to control writing malloc stats at exit:
	  malloc_trace_at_exit, 0 by default

lib/malloc/malloc.c
	- heavily updated:
		o partial page allocated on first call to malloc to make
		  subsequent sbrks page-aligned no longer wasted
		o begin and end range guards are now the same value: the chunk
		  requested
		o coalescing code was changed to attempt to coalesce first two
		  adjacent blocks on the free list; enabled by default
		o blocks of size 32 are now candidates for larger block
		  splitting, since 32 is the most popular size
		o blocks of size 32 are now candidates for smaller block
		  coalescing
		o the IN_BUCKET check was changed to just make sure that the
		  size isn't too big for the bucket, since the `busy block'
		  checking code may increase the bucket by one or more,
		  meaning that the old check would fail and cause a panic when
		  a chunk allocated in such a way was freed
		o bin sizes are now precomputed and looked up in an array
		  rather than being computed at runtime
		o moved the _mstats declaration here to avoid the stats code
		  being linked in even when no stats functions were called
		  (only matters if MALLOC_DEBUG is defined)
		o malloc now keeps track of the address of the top of the heap
		  and will return large chunks to the system with calls to
		  sbrk with a negative argument when freeing the top chunk.
		  Two thresholds:  LESSCORE_FRC means to unconditionally return
		  memory to the system; LESSCORE_MIN means to return memory if
		  there's at least one block already on the free list

lib/malloc/mstats.h
	- stats struct now keeps track of number of block coalesces by bin,
	  and the number of times memory was returned to the system by bin

lib/malloc/stats.c
	- trace_malloc_stats now takes a second argument: the name of the file
	  to write to.  The first `%p' in the template file name is replaced
	  by the pid

				    4/9
				    ---
lib/malloc/imalloc.h
	- added some macros derived from dlmalloc and glibc malloc to inline
	  memcpy and memset if the requested size is <= 32 bytes

lib/malloc/malloc.c
	- use MALLOC_MEMSET instead of memset in internal_{malloc,free}

include/ocache.h
	- use OC_MEMSET (variant of MALLOC_MEMSET) in ocache_free

configure.in, config.h.in
	- check for getservent(), define HAVE_GETSERVENT if found

bashline.c
	- punt immediately from bash_servicename_completion_function if
	  HAVE_GETSERVENT is not defined (cygwin seems to not define it)
	- include "input.h" for extern save_token_state() and
	  restore_token_state() declarations
	- change bash_execute_unix_command to call parse_and_execute with
	  SEVAL_NOHIST flag so the command doesn't get saved on the history
	  list
	- change bash_execute_unix_command to save and restore the current
	  command line count and the token state (last_read_token, etc.).
	  Everything else is saved by either parse_and_execute directly or
	  the call it makes to push_stream().  The shell_input_line stuff
	  doesn't need to be saved and restored; it's not computed until
	  readline() returns

lib/glob/glob.[ch]
	- glob_filename and glob_vector now take an additional `flags' arg
	- define GX_MARKDIRS as possible flag value for glob_filename and
	  glob_vector

lib/sh/snprintf.c
	- fixed some bugs with handling of `g' and `G' formats
	- make sure numtoa returns the fractional part correctly when passed 0
	- implemented thousands grouping for `'' flag character

lib/sh/rename.c
	- a few changes to make it more bulletproof

				   4/11
				   ----
lib/glob/glob.c
	- added the couple of dozen lines of code to glob_dir_to_array to
	  finish implementing GX_MARKDIRS

builtins/set.def
	- changed unset builtin so that it no longer considers unsetting an
	  unset variable or function to be an error

lib/readline/display.c
	- fix to rl_redisplay for a problem which caused display to be messed
	  up when the last line of a multi-line prompt (possibly containing
	  invisible characters) was longer than the screen width

				   4/15

aclocal.m4

Makefile.in, {builtins,support}/Makefile.in
	- new variables, CFLAGS_FOR_BUILD and CPPFLAGS_FOR_BUILD, substituted
	  by `configure'
	- changed CCFLAGS_FOR_BUILD to BASE_CCFLAGS, removing $(CPPFLAGS);
	  CCFLAGS and CCFLAGS_FOR_BUILD now include $(BASE_CCFLAGS) with
	  (possibly) different values for CPPFLAGS and CFLAGS 
	- GCC_LINT_CFLAGS now includes $(BASE_CCFLAGS) and $(CPPFLAGS)
	  instead of CCFLAGS_FOR_BUILD
	- new variable, LDFLAGS_FOR_BUILD, right now equivalent to LDFLAGS
	- remove $(CPPFLAGS) from recipes for buildversion, mksignames, and
	  mksyntax

configure.in
	- compute and substitute CFLAGS_FOR_BUILD, CPPFLAGS_FOR_BUILD, and
	  LDFLAGS_FOR_BUILD
	- changed qnx to use LOCAL_LDFLAGS and LOCAL_LIBS instead of putting
	  everything in LOCAL_LDFLAGS

builtins/Makefile.in
	- remove $(PROFILE_FLAGS) from recipe for building `mkbuiltins'
	- use LDFLAGS_FOR_BUILD instead of LDFLAGS in recipe for building
	  `mkbuiltins'

Makefile.in

	  test programs (printenv, recho, zecho)

support/Makefile.in
	- use CC_FOR_BUILD and CCFLAGS_FOR_BUILD in recipe for building

lib/tilde/Makefile.in
	- substitute PROFILE_FLAGS, use PROFILE_FLAGS in $(CCFLAGS)

Makefile.in, configure.in
	- moved RELSTATUS to configure.in; configure substitutes it into

lib/sh/snprintf.c
	- fix wchars() to deal with systems where MB_CUR_MAX is not a
	  constant expression

				    5/2
				    ---
lib/sh/shquote.c
	- add `,' to list of chars that are backslash-quoted.  It doesn't
	  hurt normal usage and prevents filenames with commas from being
	  inappropriately split by brace expansion after using
	  complete-into-braces

				    5/6
				    ---
lib/sh/xstrchr.c
	- we only need the check of MB_CUR_MAX and the slow code for a
	  few encodings, and even then only for a subset of the charset

arrayfunc.c
	- some speedups for skipsubscript and multibyte chars from Bruno Haible

locale.c
	- changed set_lang to call setlocale(LC_ALL, ...) if LC_ALL doesn't
	  already have a value, but doesn't change any shell variables

include/shmbutil.h
	- major speedups from Bruno Haible, mostly concerned with reducing
	  the number of strlen(3) calls

subst.c
	- change callers of macros in shmbutil.h to add extra argument as
	  necessary
	- skip_single_quoted and skip_double_quoted take another argument:
	  the length of the string; mostly useful when using multibyte chars
	- many speedups from precomputing string lengths at function start
	- fixed a small bug in de_backslash in the midst of rewriting for
	  better efficiency

{braces,make_cmd,pathexp}.c
	- change callers of macros in shmbutil.h to add extra argument as
	  necessary

pathexp.c
	- fix a one-too-far problem with multibyte chars in
	  unquoted_glob_pattern_p

braces.c
	- brace_gobbler takes a new argument, the length of the passed string
	- expand_amble takes a new argument, the length of the passed string

				    5/7

subst.c
	- modified remove_quoted_nulls to eliminate the memory allocation and
	  do the copy in place using the same strategy as de_backslash

lib/readline/{rldefs.h,complete.c}
	- new define RL_QF_OTHER_QUOTE, so _rl_find_completion_word can note
	  that it found a quoting character other than \'" that appears in
	  rl_completer_quote_characters

				    5/9

builtins/common.h
	- new #defines to use for value of changed_dollar_vars (provides

POSIX
	- new file, was in CWRU/POSIX.NOTES

doc/{Makefile.in,Makefile}
	- changed `posix' rule to modify ../POSIX

doc/mkposix
	- write to `POSIX' by default

lib/sh/strtrans.c
	- when ansicstr is parsing a format string for `echo -e' (or the
	  equivalent xpg_echo option is enabled), obey the POSIX-2001/SUSv3
	  standard and accept 0-3 octal digits after a leading `0'

doc/{bash.1,bashref.texi}
	- updated `echo' description to note that up to three octal digits
	  are now accepted following `\0'

				   5/16
				   ----
doc/Makefile.in
	- remove the generated documentation on `make distclean' if the
	  build directory and source directory are not the same

Makefile.in
	- descend into `support' subdirectory on a `make clean' and
	  `make distclean'
	- remove parser-built, y.tab[ch] on a `make distclean' if the build
	  directory and source directory are not the same

support/Makefile.in
	- support various `clean' targets and remove man2html.o and man2html

{configure,Makefile}.in

	  default for development versions; off by default for releases
	  (off for profiling, too)

				   5/21

parse.y
	- modified the grammar to allow a simple_list followed by yacc_EOF
	  to terminate a command.  This fixes problems with things like
	  a backslash-newline at the end of an `eval'd string
	- change handle_eof_input_unit() to reset the token state before
	  calling prompt_again(), in case the prompt to be evaluated contains
	  a command substitution

				   5/23

				   5/24
				   ----
lib/malloc/watch.c
	- don't try to print `file' argument to _watch_warn if it's null

lib/malloc/malloc.c
	- changed guard checking code in internal_{malloc,free,realloc} to
	  access memory as (char *) and copy into a union instead of
	  casting and dereferencing a pointer to u_bits32_t, since that
	  results in unaligned accesses which will cause Sparcs to upchuck

shell.c
	- change init_noninteractive to init expand_aliases to the value of
	  posixly_correct
	- don't initialize expand_aliases to posixly_correct anywhere else.
	  This allows the -O expand_aliases invocation option to work correctly

general.c
	- fix move_to_high_fd to not try the dup2 unless the fd loop results
	  in an fd > 3; just return the passed file descriptor otherwise
	- use HIGH_FD_MAX, defined in general.h, instead of hard-coded 256
	  as highest file descriptor to try

subst.c
	- in process_substitute, call move_to_high_fd with `maxfd' parameter
	  of -1 instead of 64, so move_to_high_fd will use its maximum

builtins/common.c

	  to builtin_error

bashline.c
	- when using command completion and trying to avoid appending a slash
	  if there's a directory with the same name in the current directory,
	  use absolute_pathname() instead of just checking whether the first
	  char of the match is a slash to catch things like ./ and ../

examples/complete/bashcc-1.0.1.tar.gz
	- a package of completions for Clear Case, from Richard S. Smith
	  (http://www.rssnet.org/bashcc.html)

input.c
	- fix check_bash_input to call sync_buffered_stream if the passed fd
	  is 0 and the shell is currently reading input from fd 0 -- all it
	  should cost is maybe an additional read system call, and it fixes
	  the bug where an input redirection to a builtin inside a script
	  which is being read from stdin causes the already-read-and-buffered
	  part of the script to be thrown away, e.g.:

		bash < x1

	  where x1 is

		hostname
		read Input < t.in
		echo $Input
		echo xxx

execute_cmd.c
	- in initialize_subshell(), call unset_bash_input (0) to not mess with
	  fd 0 if that's where bash thinks it's reading input from.  Fixes
	  bug reported by jg@cs.tu-berlin.de on 17 July 2002.  Should be a way
	  to check whether or not the current fd 0 at the time of the call has
	  not been redirected, like in the bug report.  Also might eventually
	  want to throw in a sync_buffered_stream if bash is reading input
	  from fd 0 in a non-interactive shell into a buffered stream, so the
	  stream is sync'd -- might be necessary for some uses

				   7/25
				   ----
lib/readline/signals.c
	- make sure rl_catch_sigwinch is declared even if SIGWINCH is not
	  defined, so the readline state saving and restoring functions in
	  readline.c are always the same size even if SIGWINCH is not defined,
	  and undefined references don't occur when SIGWINCH is not defined

				   7/30
				   ----
bashline.c
	- augment patch from 7/24 to not disable rl_filename_completion_desired
	  if the first char of the match is `~'

lib/readline/bind.c
	- when creating `shadow' keymaps `bound' to ANYOTHERKEY, don't bind
	  a key whose type is ISFUNC but whose function is the `fake'
	  rl_do_lowercase_version (fixes debian bash bug #154123)

lib/readline/readline.c
	- don't call _rl_vi_set_last from _rl_dispatch_subseq if
	  key == ANYOTHERKEY (when truncated to `sizeof(char)', it will be 0,
	  which strchr will find in `vi_textmod')

				   7/31
				   ----
lib/readline/input.c
	- fix rl_gather_tyi to only slurp up one line of available input, even
	  if more than one line is available (fixes debian bash bug #144585)

				    8/3
				    ---
bashline.c
	- better fix for command completion problem -- test for directory
	  explicitly with test_for_directory before turning off
	  rl_filename_completion_desired, since that's the case we're trying
	  to protect against

				    8/5
				    ---
include/shmbutil.h
	- fix ADVANCE_CHAR macro to advance the string pointer if mbrlen
	  returns 0, indicating that the null wide character (wide string
	  terminator) was found (debian bash bug #155436)

lib/readline/mbutil.c
	- fix _rl_adjust_point to increment the string pointer if mbrlen
	  returns 0

support/shobj-conf
	- fix for the `-install_name' value in SHLIB_XLDFLAGS assignment for
	  Darwin from the fink folks

				    8/6
				    ---
builtins/exit.def
	- broke code that runs ~/.bash_logout out into a separate function:
	  bash_logout()

builtins/common.h
	- extern declaration for bash_logout()

eval.c
	- call bash_logout() from alrm_catcher(), so timed-out login shells
	  run ~/.bash_logout before processing the exit trap

lib/sh/strtrans.c
	- implemented $'\x{hexdigits}' expansion from ksh93

configure.in
	- define RECYCLES_PIDS in LOCAL_CFLAGS for cygwin; don't bother to
	  link with -luser32

examples/loadables/strftime.c
	- new loadable builtin, interface to strftime(3)

				    8/7
				    ---
parse.y
	- parse_arith_cmd now takes a second argument, a flag saying whether
	  or not to add double quotes to a parsed arithmetic command; changed
	  callers
	- changed parse_dparen so it tells parse_arith_cmd to not add the
	  double quotes and therefore doesn't need to remove them
	- change parse_dparen to add W_NOGLOB|W_NOSPLIT|W_QUOTED flags to word
	  created when parsing (( ... )) arithmetic command, since the double
	  quotes are no longer added

make_cmd.c
	- in make_arith_for_expr, set the flags on the created word to
	  W_NOGLOB|W_NOSPLIT|W_QUOTED

execute_cmd.c
	- change execute_arith_command to expand the expression with
	  expand_words_no_vars, like the arithmetic for command code does
	- fix execute_arith_command to handle the case where the expanded
	  expression results in a NULL word without crashing

tests/{arith-for,cprint}.tests
	- change expected output to account for no longer adding quotes to
	  ((...)) commands

				    8/8
				    ---
print_cmd.c
	- take out the space after printing the `((' and before printing the
	  `))' in print_arith_command, print_arith_for_command, and
	  xtrace_print_arith_cmd

tests/{arith-for,cprint}.tests
	- change expected output to account for no longer adding leading and
	  trailing spaces when printing ((...)) and arithmetic for commands

				   8/17
				   ----
subst.c
	- fix issep() define to handle case where separators[0] == '\0', in
	  which case it always returns false

lib/readline/histexpand.c
	- fix off-by-one error in history_expand_internal when using the `g'
	  modifier that causes it to skip every other match when matching a
	  single character (reported by gjyun90@resl.auto.inha.ac.kr)

doc/{bash.1,bashref.texi}
	- make sure that the name=word form of argument to declare/typeset,
	  export, and readonly is documented in the description

				   8/30
				   ----
lib/readline/histexpand.c
	- make history_expand_internal understand double quotes, because
	  single quotes are not special inside double quotes, according to
	  our shell-like quoting conventions.  We don't want unmatched
	  single quotes inside double-quoted strings inhibiting history
	  expansion
	- make `a' modifier equivalent to `g' modifier for compatibility with
	  the BSD csh
	- add a `G' modifier that performs a given substitution once per word
	  (tokenized as the shell would do it) like the BSD csh `g' modifier

				   8/31
				   ----
braces.c
	- when compiling for the shell, treat ${...} like \{...} instead of
	  trying to peek backward when we see a `{'.  This makes it easier
	  to handle things like \${, which should be brace expanded because
	  the $ is quoted

				    9/7
				    ---
aclocal.m4
	- redirect stdin from /dev/null in BASH_CHECK_DEV_FD before testing
	  the readability of /dev/fd/0, so we're dealing with a known quantity

				   9/11
				   ----
[prayers for the victims of 9/11/01]

shell.c
	- fix maybe_make_restricted to handle a restricted login shell with a
	  base pathname of `-rbash' and skip over any leading `-'

				   9/13
				   ----
builtins/evalstring.c
	- in parse_and_execute, make sure we don't try to run unwind-protects
	  back to `pe_dispose' after a longjmp back to top_level if the
	  pe_dispose frame hasn't been initialized

lib/readline/display.c
	- fix problem with prompt overwriting previous output when the output
	  doesn't contain a newline in a multi-byte locale.  This also should
	  fix the problem of bash slowing down drastically on long lines when
	  using a multi-byte locale, because it no longer tries to rewrite the
	  entire line each time.  Patch from Jiro SEKIBA <jir@yamato.ibm.com>

parse.y
	- move the typedef for alias_t that is compiled in if ALIAS is not
	  defined up before the prototype for push_string, since that takes
	  an alias_t * parameter

lib/readline/terminal.c
	- bind the termcap description's left and right arrow keys to
	  rl_backward_char and rl_forward_char, respectively,  instead of
	  rl_forward and rl_backward (which are just there for backwards
	  compatibility)

aclocal.m4
	- when testing readability of /dev/stdin, redirect stdin from /dev/null
	  to make sure it's a readable file

				   9/17
				   ----
config-bot.h
	- don't test __STDC__ when deciding whether or not to use stdarg.h;
	  just use it if it's present

tests/read2.sub
	- redirect from /dev/tty when using `read -t' 

				   9/20
				   ----
builtins/history.def
	- when reading `new' entries from the history file with `history -n',
	  fix increment of history_lines_this_session by taking any change
	  in history_base into account

lib/sh/pathphys.c
	- changes to sh_physpath to deal with pathnames that end up being
	  longer than PATH_MAX without dumping core

lib/readline/doc/{history.3,hsuser.texinfo},doc/ bash.1
	- documented new `a' and `G' history modifiers

				   9/25
				   ----
lib/readline/misc.c
	- when traversing the history list with arrow keys in vi insertion
	  mode, put the cursor at the end of the line (like in emacs mode)

mksyntax.c
	- don't try to use \a and \v unless __STDC__ is defined; use the
	  ascii integer equivalents otherwise
	- include "config.h" in the generated syntax.c file for a possible
	  definition of `const'

doc/{bash.1,bashref.texi}
	- document the meaning of a null directory in $PATH

				   9/26
				   ----
parse.y
	- fix set_line_mbstate to handle case where mbrlen() returns 0,
	  indicating the null wide character
	- fix set_line_mbstate so we don't directly compare a char variable
	  to EOF, since char can (and is) unsigned on some machines

bashline.c
	- change bash_execute_unix_command to save a little bit more state:
	  last_shell_builtin, this_shell_builtin, last_command_exit_value

				   9/27
				   ----
execute_cmd.c
	- tentative change to execute_simple_command to avoid freeing freed
	  memory in the case where bash forks early but still ends up calling
	  execute_disk_command, without passing newly-allocated memory to
	  make_child.  This may fix the core dumps with the linux-from-scratch
	  folks

				   9/28
				   ----
Makefile.in,{builtins,lib/sh}/Makefile.in	
	- fix up dependencies, mostly on ${BUILD_DIR}/version.h, so that
	  parallel makes work with GNU and BSD makes

shell.h
	- new struct to save partial parsing state when doing things like
	  bash_execute_unix_command and other operations that execute
	  commands while a line is being entered and parsed

parse.y
	- new functions, save_parser_state() and restore_parser_state(), to
	  save and restore partial parsing state 

bashline.c
	- change bash_execute_unix_command to call {save,restore}_parser_state

builtins/jobs.def
	- change execute_list_with_replacements to eliminate a run_unwind_frame
	  in favor of calling the cleanup explicitly and discarding the frame

execute_cmd.c
	- change execute_for_command to avoid a run_unwind_frame in the case
	  where the loop variable is readonly or otherwise not assignable
	- change execute_select_command and execute_simple_command to use
	  discard_unwind_frame by running the cleanup code explicitly, instead
	  of using run_unwind_frame
	- make sure execute_select_command decreases loop_level even on error

				   9/30
				   ----
doc/{bash.1,bashref.texi}
	- fixed description of `unset' now that unsetting a previously-unset
	  variable is no longer an error

				   10/3
				   ----
{configure,config.h}.in
	- augment check for strtold with additional check to detect the
	  horribly broken hp/ux 11.x implementation that returns `long_double';
	  defines STRTOLD_BROKEN if so

builtins/printf.def
	- define floatmax_t as `double' if STRTOLD_BROKEN is defined

				   10/5
				   ----
lib/readline/keymaps.c
	- don't automatically bind uppercase keys to rl_do_lowercase_version
	  in rl_make_bare_keymap

lib/readline/readline.c
	- explicitly check for ANYOTHERKEY binding to rl_do_lowercase_version
	  and dispatch to lowercase of key when a prefix is not matched

				   10/12
				   -----
bashline.c
	- set COMP_WORDBREAKS in enable_hostname_completion to the value
	  of rl_completer_word_break_characters

variables.c
	- new special variable COMP_WORDBREAKS, controls the value of
	  rl_completer_word_break_characters

variables.h
	- new extern declaration for sv_comp_wordbreaks()

subst.c
	- change split_at_delims to behave more like shell word splitting if
	  the passed value for the delimiters is NULL, indicating that the
	  function is to use $IFS to split

{execute_cmd,jobs,test,findcmd,input,make_cmd,redir,shell}.c
builtins/mkbuiltins.c,builtins/{fc,history,source,umask}.def
lib/sh/netconn.c
lib/termcap/termcap.c
lib/readline/histfile.c
	- make sure all inclusions of <sys/file.h> are protected by
	  HAVE_SYS_FILE_H

bashline.c
	- don't turn off rl_filename_completion_desired in
	  attempt_shell_completion if the partial pathname contains a slash.
	  This still doesn't solve the problem of partial pathname completion
	  starting with a directory in the current directory without a
	  leading `./'.  There's no way to tell the difference between that
	  and a file found in $PATH (which may contain `.') at the point that
	  attempt_shell_completion acts

				   10/18
				   -----
locale.c
	- don't set lc_all to the default locale when LC_ALL is being unset
	- new function, reset_locale_vars(), called to recompute the correct
	  locale variable values when LC_ALL is unset
	- changed set_lang to not set LC_ALL, which it never should have been
	  doing in the first place, and to maintain a local variable `lang'
	  corresponding to $LANG
	- change get_locale_var to use the precedence posix.2 specifies:
	  LC_ALL overrides individual variables; LANG, if set, is the default
	- change set_locale_var to call get_locale_var to get the appropriate
	  value for the variable being set or unset
	- call get_locale_var instead of using passed value in set_locale_var
	  to get the defaulting and precedence right

lib/readline/nls.c
	- new function, _rl_get_locale_var(), which does the same thing as
	  locale.c:get_locale_var(), with the right precedence and defaulting,
	  using sh_get_env_value to get the right bash variable values
	- if HAVE_SETLOCALE is defined, _rl_init_eightbit first calls
	  _rl_get_locale_var to get the right value for LC_CTYPE, and uses
	  that in the call to setlocale.  If _rl_get_locale_var returns NULL,
	  call setlocale() to get the current international environment, and,
	  finally, if that returns null, call setlocale with a second argument
	  of "" to force the implementation's `native' environment

pcomplete.c
	- change gen_wordlist_completions to dequote the text before comparing
	  it against the expanded word list 
	- changed gen_matches_from_itemlist to do the same thing

bashline.c
	- new global function, bash_dequote_word, calls bash_dequote_filename
	  on the text passed.  Used by the programmable completion code

lib/readline/histfile.c
	- make sure that whenever read_history_range returns a non-zero value
	  that it sets errno to some useful value

				   10/19
				   -----
variables.c
	- COMP_WORDBREAKS is now a dynamic variable, mirroring value of
	  rl_completer_word_break_characters.  Makes sure that the variable
	  always points to dynamic memory if it's not null or the readline
	  default

bashline.c
	- change enable_hostname_completion to manage a dynamic value of
	  rl_completer_word_break_characters, since assignments to
	  COMP_WORDBREAKS can change its value unpredictably

lib/readline/{complete.c,readline.h}
	- rl_completer_word_break_characters no longer has `const' attribute

bashline.c
	- clean up necessary places due to rl_completer_word_break_characters
	  no longer being `const'

doc/{bash.1,bashref.texi}
	- document new COMP_WORDBREAKS variable

				   10/21
				   -----
print_cmd.c
	- fix indirection_level_string to handle the case where the decoded
	  $PS4 is null without seg faulting

				   10/22
				   -----
builtins/shift.def
	- make sure that there is actually an argument when reporting a shift
	  count that exceeds the number of positional paramters and
	  shift_verbose is enabled

lib/readline/rltty.c
	- change SET_SPECIAL to call a new function, set_special_char, since
	  it contains a block.  It's called infrequently, so the performance
	  impact of making it a function should be negligible, and it helps
	  debugging

				   10/29
				   -----
bashline.c
	- make sure the editor in VI_EDIT_COMMAND and EMACS_EDIT_COMMAND is
	  quoted; it might contain spaces (e.g., `emacs -nw')

aclocal.m4
	- cache ac_cv_rl_version in RL_LIB_READLINE_VERSION macro

configure.in
	- change logic that sets RL_INCLUDEDIR so that it doesn't try to set
	  a bogus include path if the argument to --with-installed-readline
	  is `yes' -- helps with cross-compiling

lib/readline/histexpand.c
	- fix history_tokenize_word so that it handles <( and >( better

				   10/30
				   -----
redir.c
	- fix write_here_string so it handles the case where `herestr' expands
	  to NULL without seg faulting

				   10/31
				   -----
mailcheck.c
	- reverse logic flip from bash-2.05 that handled systems that don't
	  change the atime when the mailbox is accessed; make sure the file
	  is bigger before we report new mail.  This is the case in the vast
	  majority of cases.  Reported by jim@jtan.com

				   11/5
				   ----
parse.y
	- change action for `for x; { list; }' and corresponding `select'
	  production to use \"$@\" instead of just $@, as it is with all the
	  other actions

				   11/9
				   ----
parse.y
	- new flag for parse_matched_pair: P_DQUOTE, indicating that the
	  pair of characters being matched is between double quotes
	- parse_matched_pair now passes P_DQUOTE down to recursive calls:
	  if the open char to be matched is a `"' or the passed-in flags
	  include P_DQUOTE, set the local `rflags' variable to P_DQUOTE and
	  pass `rflags' down to recursive calls
	- if `rflags' includes P_DQUOTE, don't try to ansiexpand $'...' or
	  locale expand $"..."; consistent with other quoting constructs

				   11/11
				   -----
doc/{bash.1,bashref.texi}
	- explicitly note that variables referenced in arithmetic expressions
	  without using `$' evaluate to 0 if they are null or unset
	- note that a null variable value evaluates to 0 when used in an
	  arithmetic context, like when a variable with the `-i' attribute is
	  assigned a null value
	- document the ${!prefix@} expansion as equivalent to ${!prefix*}

				   11/12
				   -----
doc/{bash.1,bashref.texi}
	- note that the value of an arithmetic expression is as in C
	- change the wording to note that `arithmetic evaluation' (not
	  arithmetic expansion, which has a different meaning) is performed
	  on the value assigned to a variable whose integer attribute is set

				   11/13
				   -----
execute_cmd.c
	- fix execute_disk_command so it calls exit() after printing the error
	  message in a restricted shell context if the shell has already forked
	  (nofork != 0 && there are no pipes)

				   11/19
				   -----
builtins/type.def
	- don't report on aliases unless expand_aliases is set and the parser
	  is performing alias expansion; changed tests/type.tests and
	  tests/type.right accordingly

				   11/25
				   -----
general.c
	- fix for full pathnames including drive letters on cygwin from
	  Corinna (convert to posix-style paths, which the rest of the
	  code handles much better)

lib/readline/text.c
	- fixes to overwrite mode from jimmy@is-vn.bg:
		o in _rl_overwrite_char, do the overwrite mode self-insert
		  as one group, even when overwriting more than 1 char
		o in _rl_overwrite_char, do the insert before the delete so
		  that an undo positions the cursor on the character restored,
		  not to the right of it
		o in _rl_overwrite_rubout, don't do rl_insert_char(' ') unless
		  rl_point < rl_end.  Since overwrite-mode self-insert acts as
		  in insert-mode when at eol, make rubout behave like
		  insert-mode rubout

				   11/30
				   -----
lib/readline/misc.c
	- call rl_replace_line with `1' as second parameter if we're going to
	  immediately overwrite the undo list

lib/readline/search.c
	- in make_history_line_current, use _rl_replace_text to make the line
	  replacement an undoable operation.  Affects all non-incremental
	  search functions.

parse.y
	- make behavior introduced on 11/9 dependent on extended_quote
	  variable, controllable by extquote shopt option.  Default setting is
	  on for backwards compatibility

builtins/shopt.def
	- new `extquote' option to control extended_quote variable

				   12/3

jobs.c
	- change message printed when attempting to put a background job in
	  the background with `bg' to include the job id and make the
	  statement declarative

				   -----
bashhist.h
	- define explicit flag values for history_control

variables.c
	- change sv_history_control to use new flag values
	- change sv_history_control to parse $HISTCONTROL as a colon-separated
	  list of values for the history_control variable

bashhist.c
	- change check_history_control to use new flag values and restructure
	  to remove case statement
	- new function hc_erasedups(line); removes all entries matching LINE
	  from the history list
	- call hc_erasedups() from check_add_history after we've determined
	  that we're saving the line

doc/{bash.1,bashref.texi}
	- documented new options available for $HISTCONTROL and that it can
	  be a colon-separated list of history control options

				   12/11
				   -----
subst.c
	- fix pat_subst() to not increment `e' (pointer to the end of the
	  matched portion of the string) until after we're sure we're going
	  around the loop again; fixes problem with empty replacements for
	  a pattern that doesn't match (bug reported by Don Coleman
	  <don@coleman.org>)

				   12/17
				   -----
lib/readline/display.c
	- fixes to multibyte redisplay from jir@yamato.ibm.com (Jiro SEKIBA):
		o speed up calculation of first difference between old and new
		  lines in the common case
		o don't try to see if we're in the middle of a multbyte char
		  in update_line (we'll see how this one works out)

				   12/18
				   -----
doc/bashref.texi
	- make it clear that the `command-list' function definition may be
	  terminated by an ampersand before the closing brace

				   12/28
				   -----
redir.c
	- set `expanding_redir' flag when expanding words in a redirection

subst.c
	- new function, exp_jump_to_top_level(), to do any word expansion
	  cleanup before a call to jump_to_top_level from within that file;
	  sets expanding_redir back to 0 before jump_to_top_level

variables.c
	- in find_variable(), don't call find_variable_internal with a second
	  parameter of 1 if expanding_redir is non-zero
	- in find_variable_internal(), don't search the temporary env if
	  subshell_environment includes SUBSHELL_FORK (indicating a simple
	  command) and expanding_redir is non-zero

parse.y
	- increment line_number when we read a \<newline> pair

array.c
	- added array_unshift_element and array_shift_element (which just call
	  array_shift and array_rshift, respectively), for bash debugger
	  support

				 1/4/2003
				 --------
doc/{bash.1,bashref.texi}
	- note in the section describing the execution environment passed to
	  children that subshells inherit shell functions marked for export
	- note in the section describing shell functions the possibility
	  that exported functions may result in two entries in the environment
	  with the same name

parse.y
	- when pushing an alias expansion onto the pushed_string list, append
	  a space to the expanded definition to make the parser's lookahead
	  work without using the `mustpop' hack in shell_getc

				    1/8
				    ---
shell.c
	- change calls to exit() with EX_USAGE as a parameter to use
	  EX_BADUSAGE instead, since EX_USAGE is defined as 258 and is
	  technically out of range

				   1/14
				   ----
aclocal.m4
	- check for the termcap functions in libc first:  if we don't have
	  to link in another library, let's not do it
	- change the test for mbstate_t to use AC_TRY_COMPILE instead of
	  AC_TRY_RUN

doc/{bash.1,bashref.texi}
	- document that bash turns line editing off if environment variable
	  EMACS is set to `t' when it starts up

doc/bash.1
	- minor change to give the ftp url for the latest version of bash in
	  the bug reports section

lib/readline/histexpand.c
	- in get_history_event, cast a couple of `const char *' variables to
	  `char *' in function call parameter lists to avoid compiler warnings

				   1/21
				   ----
builtins/cd.def
	- change `cd -' so it prints the current working directory after a
          successful chdir even when the shell is not interactive

				   1/31
				   ----
lib/readline/doc/rltech.texinfo
	- clarified exactly what is meant by the term `application-specific
	  completion function', made its use consistent, and documented
	  what variables are changed before such a function is called

lib/readline/input.c
	- new function, _rl_pushed_input_available(), returns non-zero if
	  there are characters in the input queue managed by rl_get_char
	  and _rl_unget_char

lib/readline/rlprivate.h
	- new extern declaration for _rl_pushed_input_available

lib/readline/callback.c
	- change rl_callback_read_char to check _rl_pushed_input_available
	  and loop if there's something there, so characters don't languish
	  until more keyboard input is read

execute_cmd.c
	- new variable, last_command_exit_signal, non-zero if
	  last_command_exit_value result from wait_for was result of a signal

nojobs.c
	- keep track of whether or not a given pid was killed by a signal with
	  a new flag in the pid_list array
	- new function int find_termsig_by_pid(pid_t pid) to get the
	  terminating signal, if any, for a particular pid
	- new function int get_termsig(WAIT status) returns the terminating
	  signal corresponding to status
	- set last_command_exit_signal in wait_for and the various wait_for_xx
	  functions

jobs.c
	- new functions, process_exit_signal and job_exit_signal, return the
	  signal that killed a given process or job, if a signal caused its
	  death
	- set last_command_exit_signal in wait_for by calling job_exit_signal
	  or process_exit_signal appropriately

subst.c
	- don't resend SIGINT to ourselves unless last_command_exit_signal is
	  SIGINT and last_command_exit_value == 128 + SIGINT.  This fixes the
	  $(exit 130) bug reported by Paul Jarc

expr.c
	- new function, expr_bind_variable, calls bind_int_variable and
	  then stupidly_hack_special_variables.  This fixes the
	  `let OPTIND=1' bug

bashline.c
	- change history_and_alias_expand_line and shell_expand_line to call
	  history_expand_line_internal so calls to pre_process_line are
	  localized
	- change history_expand_line_internal and cleanup_expansion_error to
	  temporarily turn off hist_verify before calling pre_process_line
	  to avoid the effects described by teirllm@dms.auburn.edu

parse.y
	- don't unconditionally turn off PST_ALEXPNEXT in push_string.  This
	  fixes the multiple alias expansion bug reported by Paul Jarc.

lib/readline/vi_mode.c
	- change rl_vi_subst to push `l' instead of ` ' -- it should be
	  equivalent, but this has been reported to fix a problem in multibyte
	  locales

lib/readline/readline.h
	- new state flag value RL_STATE_TTYCSAVED, indicates that save_tty_chars
	  has been called.  Since it's only used and visible internally, it's
	  undocumented

lib/readline/rltty.h
	- changed all of the members of _rl_tty_chars struct to `unsigned char'

lib/readline/rltty.c
	- set the RL_STATE_TTYCSAVED after save_tty_chars is called
	- new function, rl_tty_unset_default_bindings(), resets bindings for
	  everything rl_tty_set_default_bindings() messes with back to
	  rl_insert, so rl_tty_set_default_bindings can be called again with
	  possible changes
	- new function that does the bulk of the work for
	  rltty_set_default_bindings:  _rl_bind_tty_special_chars()
	- change prepare_terminal_settings so that it can track changes to the
	  terminal special chars made by stty(1):  unset the bindings with
	  rl_tty_unset_default_bindings before calling save_tty_chars, and
	  _rl_tty_set_default_bindings after, with the new values from
	  get_tty_settings().  This implements a long-standing request, most
	  recently made by Tim Waugh of Red Hat.

lib/readline/readline.h
	- extern declaration for rl_tty_unset_default_bindings()

lib/readline/readline.c
	- new function, reset_default_bindings, calls
	  rl_tty_unset_default_bindings() to reset the terminal special chars
	  back to rl_insert and then read the new ones

lib/readline/doc/rltech.texinfo
	- documented rl_tty_unset_default_bindings()

	  the string inappropriately

				   2/14
				   ----

shell.c
	- initialize BASH_LINENO, BASH_SOURCE, FUNCNAME in open_shell_script

{execute_cmd,trap}.c
	- take out trap_line_number, since parse_and_execute doesn't reset the
	  line number any more when running the trap commands

make_cmd.c
	- augment make_function_def to get source file name and call
	  bind_function_def to save the entire FUNCTION_DEF

variables.c

	  word after `for', `select' or `case' in read_token_word; decrement
	  in grammar actions after parsing a complete for, arith_for, select,
	  or case command
	- create for, case, arith_for, and select commands with an extra
	  line number (word_lineno[word_top]) argument

make_cmd.c
	- make_for_or_select, make_for_command, make_case_command, and
	  make_select_command all take an extra `line_number' argument

make_cmd.h

				   2/16
				   ----
{execute_cmd,shell,variables}.c
	- follow each call to remember_args with a call to push_args or
	  pop_args to manage the BASH_ARGV and BASH_ARGC arrays.  Only set
	  when the shell is started to run shell script or runs a shell

	  in execute_in_subshell
	- set currently_executing_command in execute_command_internal(),
	  even if we're running a trap
	- better line number management when executing simple commands,
	  conditional commands, for commands in execute_command_internal()
	  and the various functions that implement the commands

	- RETURN is a new special trap
	- new function: set_return_trap(char *command) interface for the rest
	  of the shell, like set_{debug,error}_trap

	  return trap

trap.h
	- new extern declaration for set_return_trap() and run_return_trap
	- new defines for RETURN_TRAP; increment BASH_NSIG

	  an int

shell.c
	- new invocation long option:  --debugger, turns on debugging and
	  sets internal `debugging_mode' variable

execute_cmd.c
	- new code to save return trap when executing a shell function, so
	  shell functions don't inherit it
	- run debug trap before binding the variable and running the action
	  list in a `for' command

	  into two functions each:  one to print the `header' and one for
	  the body
	- print_cond_command is no longer static
	- print_arith_command now takes a WORD_LIST *, since it doesn't
	  actually do anything with the ARITH_COM it's passed except print

	- print_arith_command is no longer static

externs.h
	- extern declarations for print_{for,select,case}_command_head,
	  print_cond_command, print_arith_command

lib/glob/glob.c
	- handle alloca() failing (it's supposed to return NULL)

	  in glob_filename()

subst.c
	- check whether shell_glob_filename returns NULL in
	  glob_expand_word_list
	- change parameter_brace_expand_rhs to handle cases like
	  ${a[2]:=value} by properly creating the array element instead of a
	  variable named `a[2]' (reported by <opengeometry@yahoo.ca>)

variables.c
	- change bind_int_variable to use valid_array_reference instead
	  of looking for `[' 

lib/readline/vi_mode.c
	- check for `a' in _rl_vi_done_inserting so the text inserted by an
	  `a' command can be reinserted with a `.'

lib/readline/readline.c
	- when entering vi insertion mode in readline_internal_setup(), make
	  sure that _rl_vi_last_key_before_insert is set to `i' so that undo
	  groups and redo work better (reported by <opengeometry@yahoo.ca>)

lib/glob/sm_loop.c
	- handle ?(...) in a pattern immediately following a `*', instead of

				   ----
execute_cmd.c
	- new variable, the_printed_command_except_trap, saves the command
	  being executed before a trap is executed, for the debugger

trap.c
	- if in debugging mode, let command substitutions and other child
	  processes inherit the DEBUG and ERR traps if the `functrace'
	  (which is really a bad name, given this semantic) or `errtrace'
	  options, respectively, have been set

shell.c
	- local_pending_command renamed to command_execution_string; no longer
	  static

variables.c
	- new dynamic variable, BASH_COMMAND, set to the command string
	  currently executing, or the one that caused a trap to execute
	  (mapped to the_printed_command_except_trap)
	- new variable, BASH_EXECUTION_STRING, set to the argument to the
	  -c invocation option, if the shell was started that way

				   3/22

execute_cmd.c
	- changed execute_for_command, eval_arith_for_expr,
	  execute_select_command, execute_arith_command, execute_cond_command,
	  execute_simple_command to implement new DEBUG trap semantics
	  for the debugger: if the DEBUG trap commands return a non-zero
	  status and debugging_mode is non-zero, we skip the command to be
	  executed

trap.c
	- change run_debug_trap for the debugger: if we're in the debugger
	  and the DEBUG trap returns 2 while we're in a function or sourced
	  script, we force a `return'

shell.c
	- new function, start_debugger(), that sources the debugger start file
	  and turns the debugger on

builtins/shopt.def
	- new settable option, `extdebug', turns on debugging_mode, as if
	  --debugger had been supplied at invocation (but does not source
	  debugger startup file)

trap.c
	- make sure that run_exit_trap arranges for `returns' to come back
	  there, too, so a `return' executed by an `exit' invoked within a
	  shell function behaves correctly

support/shobj-conf
	- change darwin/MacOS X stanza based on advice from mac os x developers

lib/sh/mailstat.c
	- set the atime member of the synthesized stat struct to 0 if `cur/'
	  is empty, rather than leaving it undefined

				   3/24
				   ----
builtins/caller.def
	- new builtin to provide a call stack for the debugger

builtins/evalfile.c
	- added a second `flags' argument to source_file()
	- new flag value for flags argument to _evalfile():  FEVAL_NOPUSHARGS.
	  If included in flags arg, it means to not manipulate the BASH_ARGV
	  and BASH_ARGC arrays

builtins/common.h
	- change prototype for source_file()

builtins/source.def
	- add flag value to call to source_file():  set to 1 if we replaced

	- add call to push_args if additional arguments supplied to the
	  source builtin
	- add call to pop_args in maybe_pop_dollar_vars

execute_cmd.c
	- run the debug trap in execute_function so the debugger can stop
	  before the first command in a function body is executed

	  subshell
	- print `for', `select', `case' command heads when set -x is enabled

print_cmd.c

	  set -x is enabled
	- add spaces after `((' and before `))' in xtrace_print_arith_command

externs.h
	- changed extern declaration for xtrace_print_word_list
	- new declarations for xtrace_print_{for,case,select}_command_head()

subst.c
	- modify subshell_level when executing a command substitution

				   3/25
				   ----
execute_cmd.c
	- use `line_number' in executing_line_number instead of looking into
	  the current command if it's a simple command; rearrange code to
	  make this simpler to compile in and out
	- need to save and restore value of currently_executing_command around
	  calls to debug trap and return trap in execute_function

make_cmd.c
	- make sure make_arith_for_command() disposes the WORD_LIST * it is
	  passed, since nothing else does and it's not used directly

				   3/28
				   ----
Makefile.in	
	- fixed dependencies for `error.o' on shell.h and version.h -- makes
	  parallel makes (gmake -j 4) work correctly

	  sh_backslash_quote_for_double_quotes
	  Fixes vulnerability reported by svdb@stack.nl

shell.h
	- new `pipestatus' member of sh_parser_state_t, to save and restore

	  restore $PIPESTATUS

builtins/read.def
	- add a call to word_list_remove_quoted_nulls before assigning the
	  word list read from standard input to an array variable.  Fixes
	  bug reported by holzhey@ppprs1.phy.tu-dresden.de

				    4/3
				    ---
execute_cmd.c
	- in execute_null_command, if redirections are supplied, make sure
	  things like 3</etc/passwd are undone immediately, since they're
	  being done in the current shell
	- functions now inherit the RETURN trap only if function tracing is
	  on for that function or globally

lib/readline/misc.c
	- in rl_replace_from_history, don't force rl_replace_line to clear
	  the undo_list, since it might point directly at an undo list
	  from a history entry (to which we have no handle)

				    4/4
				    ---
trap.c
	- initialize RETURN_TRAP stuff appropriately in initialize_traps()
	- let command substitutions inherit the RETURN trap if we're in
	  the debugger and function tracing has been enabled

redir.c
	- do_redirections and do_redirection_internal now take a single
	  flags argument instead of multiple boolean flags

redir.h
	- new #defines for flags argument to do_redirection{s,_internal}

execute_cmd.c
	- change all calls to do_redirection to use new flag values

parse.y
	- new function, free_pushed_string_input(), an external interface to
	  clear the pushed_string list (alias expansion)
	- new define SHOULD_PROMPT to say when it's OK to call prompt_again
	  (if the shell is currently interactive and is reading input from
	  the terminal or readline)
	- make sure shell_getc and read_secondary_line only call prompt_again
	  if SHOULD_PROMPT evaluates to true
	- prompt_again shouldn't do anything if the shell is currently in the
	  middle of expanding a multiline alias, since we won't be printing a
	  prompt anyway

externs.h
	- new extern declaration for free_pushed_string_input()

execute_cmd.c
	- command_substitute and process_substitute now call
	  free_pushed_string_input because they shouldn't deal with any
	  partial alias expansion the parent shell may have started

				    4/5
				    ---
braces.c
	- added {x..y} brace expansion, shorthand for {x,x+1,x+2,...,y}:
	  x, y can be integers or single characters; the sequence can be
	  ascending or descending; increment is always 1.  Beware that
	  something like {a..A} can lead to non-letters.

				    4/7
				    ---
subst.c
	- change extract_delimited_string and extract_dollar_brace_string to
	  return NULL on an expansion error when no_longjmp_on_fatal_error
	  is set, so the calling functions don't assume that the expansion
	  was successful (primarily the prompt expansion and completion code)

doc/{bash.1,bashref.texi}
	- documented new sequence generation feature of brace expansion

				    4/8
				    ---
lib/sh/strstr.c
	- replacement for strstr(3), in case the C library doesn't provide it

configure.in
	- check for strstr, add to LIBOBJS if not found

array.c
	- array_walk now takes a third void * argument; it's passed to `func'
	  as its second argument

array.h
	- change sh_ae_map_func_t prototype to add void * second argument

				   4/10
				   ----
array.c
	- new function: array_keys_to_word_list, returns a list of indices for
	  a given array

array.h
	- new extern declaration for array_keys_to_word_list

arrayfunc.c
3	- new function: char *array_keys(), returns a string with keys for a
	  given array, with the appropriate quoting

arrayfunc.h
	- new extern declaration for array_keys

subst.c
	- code to implement ksh93-like ${!array[@]} expansion (array[*] works,
	  too), which expands to all the keys (indices) of ARRAY

doc/{bash.1,bashref.texi}
	- documented new ${!array[@]} expansion

				   4/19
				   ----
builtins/setattr.def
	- remove any mention of the `-n' option from readonly builtin's short
	  and long documentation

pcomplib.c

	  to progcomp_insert with the same compspec

doc/bash.1
	- add mention of characters that inhibit history expansion when found
	  immediately following an unquoted `!'

bashline.c
	- convert the code conditionally compiled in by the NO_FORCE_FIGNORE
	  #define to something runtime-tunable with the `force_fignore'
	  variable (opposite sense).  force_fignore is 1 by default

builtins/shopt.def
	- new tunable `shopt' option: `force_fignore', controls force_fignore
	  variable and behavior of FIGNORE handling

lib/readline/complete.c
	- new variable, _rl_complete_show_unmodified, causes completer to list
	  possible completions if more than one completion and partial

	- new value for what_to_do argument to rl_complete_internal, `@',
	  indicating that we want the show-unmodified behavior
	- change rl_completion_type to return `@' when appropriate

lib/readline/bind.c
	- new bindable variable, show-all-if-unmodified, which controls value
	  of _rl_complete_show_unmodified

				   4/22
				   ----
lib/readline/signals.c
	- in rl_set_signal, set sa_flags to SA_RESTART for SIGWINCH, if we
	  have POSIX signals -- this is what most applications expect, and
	  they're not prepared to deal with EINTR

				   4/25
				   ----
bashline.c
	- take out attempts to suppress readline filename completion when
	  attempting command completion and there is a directory with the
	  same name in the current directory.  #if 0'd for now; maybe make
	  it conditional later

error.c
	- new variable, gnu_error_format, causes non-interactive errors with
	  line numbers to be printed in the `gnu style' (filename:lineno:)
	  instead of the `shell style' (filename: line lineno:) by
	  error_prolog and parser_error

version.h,support/mkversion
	- don't put extern function declarations into created version.h any
	  more

version.c,externs.h
	- add extern declarations for show_shell_version() and
	  shell_version_string(), since they're no longer in version.h
	  (this backs out change from 9/10/2001)

shell.h
	- don't include version.h

Makefile.in
	- remove unneeded dependencies on version.h -- only version.o
	  needs it now

builtins/shopt.def
	- new option `gnu_errfmt', changes error messages with line numbers
	  to use the `standard' gnu format

pcomplete.h
	- new COPT_BASHDEFAULT and COPT_PLUSDIRS defines

bashline.c
	- if the COPT_BASHDEFAULT flag is set, try the rest of the bash
	  default completions if a compspec with that flag set generates
	  no matches
	- broke bash completions out into separate function:
	  bash_default_completion(const char *text, int start, int end,
	  int qc, int in_command_position); change attempt_shell_completion
	  to call it

bashline.h
	- new extern declaration for bash_default_completion

builtins/complete.def
	- added code to compgen to call bash_default_completion if a compspec

doc/{bash.1,bashref.texi}
	- document new `gnu_errfmt' shopt option

doc/bash.1,lib/readline/doc/rluser.texi

pcomplete.c
	- if a compspec has the COPT_PLUSDIRS flag set, generate any
	  directory name completions and add them to the set of possible
	  completions as the last thing in gen_compspec_completions

builtins/complete.def
	- add new `-o plusdirs' option to complete and compgen; means to
	  do directory name completion in addition to other actions
	  specified by the compspec, and do it last

lib/readline/rlmbutil.h,include/shmbutil.h
	- new #define MB_INVALIDCH, evaluates to true if return value from
	  mbrtowc or mbrlen denotes an invalid multibyte character
	- new #define MB_NULLWCH, evaluates to true if return value from
	  mbrtowc or mbrlen denotes a null multibyte character

lib/readline/complete.c
	- new function, fnwidth(), returns printed length of a filename,
	  correctly handling multibyte characters
	- new function, fnprint(), displays a filename on rl_outstream
	  correctly handling multibyte characters
	- use fnwidth() instead of simple strlen() for length calculations
	  in display_matches

lib/readline/{display,mbutil}.c
	- use MB_INVALIDCH and MB_NULLWCH as appropriate

				   5/21
				   ----
configure.in
	- turn off the builtin malloc on GNU/FreeBSD systems (GNU userland,
	  FreeBSD kernel)

				   5/24
				   ----
pcomplete.c
	- in programmable_completions, copy the compspec before using it to
	  generate the possible completions, allowing the completion for the
	  command to be changed by the compspec itself without causing a
	  core dump because the shell frees freed memory (reported by
	  marcus.harnish@gmx.net)

parse.y
	- in shell_getc, don't call notify_and_cleanup in an interactive shell
	  unless the shell is currently reading from the terminal and would
	  print a prompt.  This fixes programmable completions printing job
	  notifications (reported by r.d.green@lancaster.ac.uk)
	- use SHOULD_PROMPT macro consistently

shell.c
	- use get_string_value instead of getenv when looking up $TERM and
	  $EMACS to see whether the shell is running under emacs
	- check for `TERM=dumb' as well as `EMACS=t' to decide whether or
	  not to turn off command-line editing in emacs shell windows
	  (reported by jik@kamens.brookline.ma.us)

				   5/28

builtins/common.c
	- in display_signal_list, when displaying for `kill -l' in posix mode,
	  display signal names without the `SIG' prefix

doc/bashref.texi
	- documented changed to posix mode behavior of kill -l

builtins/kill.def
	- changed the error message printed when argument is not a pid or
	  job id

doc/{bash.1,bashref.texi}
	- fixed a slight inconsistency in the different sections describing
	  the `promptvars' option

doc/Makefile.in
	- new rule to create `bash.info' from `bashref.info' by running sed
	  to change the internal references.  This makes the installed
	  bash.info work right
	- make the install target install bash.info after it's been modified
	  from bashref.info

				   5/30
				   ----
builtins/cd.def
	- after testing with ferror(), call clearerr if ferror() evaluates
	  to true

execute_cmd.c
	- call clearerr(stdout) after executing a builtin or function,
	  before restoring any redirections

bashhist.c
	- initialize history_comment_char in bash_history_initialize

builtins/alias.def
	- if posix mode is enabled, and the `-p' option is not supplied, don't
	  list aliases with a preceding `alias ', as POSIX.2 specifies

doc/bashref.texi
	- note new posix mode behavior of displaying alias names and values
	- note new posix mode behavior of trap builtin not checking first
	  argument to be a possible signal specification
	- note new posix mode behavior of `kill' not accepting signal names
	  with a leading `SIG'

include/stdc.h,lib/readline/rlstdc.h
	- don't check the __STRICT_ANSI__ define when deciding whether or not
	  to #undef __attribute__

trap.[ch]
	- decode_signal and signal_object_p take an additional flags arg to
	  satisfy POSIX.2 signal name translation requirements
	- change decode_signal to honor the new DSIG_NOCASE (match case-
	  insensitively) and DSIG_SIGPREFIX (allow signal specifications
	  with the `SIG' prefix) flags

builtins/{common.c,{trap,kill}.def}
	- change calls to decode_signal to add the new argument with
	  appropriate values.  For kill, POSIX.2 says case-insensitive without
	  the `SIG' prefix.  For trap, POSIX.2 says applications may decode
	  case-insensitively and with the SIG prefix

builtins/trap.def
	- when in posix mode, don't check for the first argument being a
	  possible signal spec and revert the signal handling to the
	  original disposition

				    ---
shell.h
	- new MATCH_STARSUB define, to tell the callers of the various pattern
	  substitution and removal functions that call string_list to treat
	  "$*" and "${array[*]}" appropriately
subst.c
	- if get_var_and_type encounters an array variable subscripted by `*'
	  or `$*', return VT_STARSUB or'd into the variable type value
	- callers of get_var_and_type check for VT_STARSUB in the returned type
	  this will fix problems with ${*...} not being separated with the
	  first character of $IFS when double-quoted
	- in parameter_brace_patsub, set MATCH_STARSUB if VT_STARSUB is set by
	  get_var_and_type
	- change pos_params_pat_subst to call string_list_dollar_star if
	  the match flags include MATCH_STARSUB
	- change parameter_brace_substring to call array_subrange with an
	  additional argument indicating the character indexing the array

array.c
	- change array_patsub to join the modified array elements with the
	  first character of $IFS if MATCH_STARSUB is set in the match flags
	  passed in
	- array_subrange now takes an additional argument indicating the
	  index type -- used to separate with first char of $IFS if the
	  index char is `*' and the expression is double-quoted

array.h
	- change prototype declaration of array_subrange to add additional arg

	  contains ${array[@]}, ${array[*]}, $@, or $*
	- new function, chk_atstar, performs checks for ${array[@]},
	  ${array[*]}, $@, or $* for the parameter_brace_expand* functions and

lib/sh/shmatch.c
	- fix to build correctly when arrays are not compiled into the shell

subst.c
	- fix command substitution to run any exit trap defined in the
	  command substitution before returning; the exit trap is not inherited
	  from the calling shell

lib/readline/shell.c
	- change sh_set_lines_and_columns to free the memory allocated and
	  passed to setenv(), since setenv is specified by POSIX to allocate
	  new memory and copy its arguments

jobs.c
	- change logic in make_child so that every child process attempts to
	  set the terminal's process group to the pipeline's process group
	  when PGRP_PIPE is defined, just like when it's undefined.  This is
	  reported to fix some tricky synchronization problems on Red Hat
	  Enterprise Linux 3.  Fix from Ernie Petrides <petrides@redhat.com>.

				   9/30
				   ----
builtins/printf.def
	- tescape no longer needs a `trans_squote' argument, since it's the
	  same as the `sawc' argument.  The `sawc' argument now means to do
	  the %b argument processing if non-null
	- fix processing of octal constants for %b arguments (\0 followed by
	  up to three octal digits) and other escape sequences (\ followed by
	  up to three octal digits)
	- hex constants `\xHHH' are now allowed to contain any positive
	  number of digits; previously they were restricted to two [removed]
	- allow two new escape sequences: \" and \?, for compatibility with
	  ksh93 and ANSI C

doc/{bash.1,bashref.texi}
	- documented processing that printf performs for arguments to %b
	  escape sequences

lib/sh/strtrans.c
	- add \" and \? to escape sequences recognized by `echo -e'

				   10/1
				   ----
version.c
	- use snprintf instead of sprintf if configure tells us we have it

				   10/3
				   ----
subst.c
	- in list_remove_pattern, take into account the fact that one of the
	  list elements may be NULL, and don't free the result of
	  remove_pattern() without checking
	- in remove_pattern, return savestring(param) if *param == '\0',
	  since callers expect to free() non-null return values

				   10/4
				   ----
subst.c
	- change verify_substring_values to make it clearer that the first
	  offset deals with array indices and the second deals with numbers
	  of elements, when doing array subranges with ${a[@]:e1:e2}

array.c
	- change array_subrange to make it explicit that the second offset
	  argument is a count of the desired number of elements, not an
	  ending index.  This deals with sparse arrays correctly.

				   10/6
				   ----
variables.c
	- fix memory leak in assign_in_env

				   10/8
				   ----
subst.c
	- in parameter_brace_expand, check that the last characters are `]}'
	  before checking for ${!array[@]}

execute_cmd.c,builtins/source.def
	- push and pop the args (BASH_ARGV and BASH_ARGC) when executing a
	  shell function or sourcing a script only when in debugging mode

				   10/11
				   -----
arrayfunc.c
	- make sure array_variable_name returns values for the SUBP and LENP
	  arguments if they're non-null, since callers expect to use them
	  even if the array subscript is bad

error.c
	- call exit_shell instead of sh_exit from parser_error and
	  report_error so the right things happen (running exit trap, doing
	  the right interactive cleanup, etc.)

lib/readline/complete.c
	- new variable, rl_completion_quote_character, set to any quote char
	  readline thinks it finds before any application completion
	  function is called
	- new variable, rl_completion_suppress_quote, settable by an
	  application-specific completion function.  If set to non-zero, the
	  completion code does not append a closing quote in append_to_match

lib/readline/readline.h
	- extern declarations for rl_completion_quote_character and
	  rl_completion_suppress_quote

bashline.c
	- set rl_completion_suppress_quote in command_subst_completion_function
	  because that would be inserted before any closing "`" or ")", which
	  is somewhat disconcerting

lib/readline/doc/rltech.texi
	- documented rl_completion_suppress_quote and
	  rl_completion_quote_character

				   10/13
				   -----
bashhist.c
	- use sv_histchars instead of setting history_comment_char directly in
	  bash_initialize_history so assignments to $histchars made in
	  ~/.bashrc are honored

				   10/21
				   -----
trap.c
	- make sure run_exit_trap sets `running_trap' appropriately
	- new variable, trap_saved_exit_value, set to last_command_exit_value
	  before running any trap commands; available to the rest of the
	  shell; use trap_saved_exit_value to replace some function-local
	  variables

builtins/exit.def
	- if the shell is running the exit trap, and no argument is given
	  to `exit', use trap_saved_exit_value as the exit status instead
	  of the last command exit value (which could be the previous command
	  run in the exit trap), as required by POSIX.2

				   10/25

doc/{bash.1,bashref.texi}
	- add `alias' to the list of documented `assignment statement' builtins

				   11/1
				   ----
doc/bash.1
	- remove the `.' from the sample $PATH value

parse.y
	- make sure parse_compound_assignment prompts with $PS2 if it reads
	  a newline while parsing the compound assignment statement. Bug
	  reported by Stephane Chazelas
	- parse_string_to_word_list now takes a new second argument: `int flags'
	- new parser state flag: PST_COMPASSIGN; indicates that the shell is
	  parsing a compound assignment statement
	- parse_string_to_word_list turns on PST_COMPASSIGN if `flags' arg
	  has low bit set
	- turn PST_COMPASSIGN on and off in parse_compound_assignment

externs.h
	- change prototype declaration for parse_string_to_word_list

arrayfunc.c
	- change call to parse_string_to_word_list to add new flags arg

general.c
	- assignment() takes a new `flags' second argument
	- if `flags' is non-zero, accept `[' as a legal assignment statement
	  starter character (for parsing compound array assignments)

general.h
	- add new argument to prototype declaration for assignment()

parse.y,{subst,variables}.c, builtins/{setattr,declare}.def
	- change calls to assignment() (parse.y calls with flags == 1 when
	  parser_state inlcudes PST_COMPASSIGN)

arrayfunc.c
	- in assign_array_var_from_string(), don't treat an expanded word
	  of the form [ind]=value specially unless the W_ASSIGNMENT flag is
	  set.  This means that words that are the result of expansions but
	  happen to have the same format as compound assignment statement
	  words will not be treated as such.  For instance

		v='[12]=foobar'
		a=( $v )

	  will result in a[0]='[12]=foobar' instead of a[12]=foobar.  This
	  is closer to how `regular' assignment statements are treated and
	  compatible with ksh93.  Bug reported by Stephane Chazelas

shell.c
	- new --protected argument, disables command substitution when used
	  with --wordexp (like --wordexp, it remains undocumented)
	- change run_wordexp to turn on the W_NOCOMSUB flag in each word
	  to be expanded if protected_mode is set

				   11/7
				   ----
doc/{bash.1,bashref.texi}
	- clarified the language concerning inherited signal dispositions and
	  when traps are run

support/shobj-conf
	- slight changes to the darwin (Mac OS X) stanza for MacOS X 10.3
	  (for the readline shared library builds, which shares this script)

lib/readline/histexpand.c
	- change to make `^' behave as equivalent to word one, as csh does,
	  and as the documentation states

lib/readline/display.c
	- in update_line, make sure to use col_lendiff in all calculations
	  where the cursor position is concerned (like when calculating
	  the value of _rl_last_c_pos).  Fixes bug reported by Andreas
	  Schwab

				   11/12
				   -----
trap.c
	- make _run_trap_internal catch `return' builtin longjmps and clean
	  up before longjmping on to where the return was intended to go
	  (fixes bug with not turning off SIG_INPROGRESS flag when `return'
	  executed in trap command)

				   11/18
				   -----
builtins/cd.def
	- in posix mode, set errno to ENOTDIR if canonicalization fails,
	  unless the canonicalization functions leave it set to ENOENT

				   11/25
				   -----
make_cmd.c
	- in make_simple_command, don't blindly dereference element.redirect

parse.y
	- the list_terminator production now has an `int' value so it can be
	  used in other grammar productions
	- add a rule that makes `time' on a line by itself time a null
	  command (this is iffy)

				   11/28
				   -----
subst.c
	- change the pattern substitution code (${var//pat/rep}) to use the
	  same pattern expansion function (getpattern()) as the pattern
	  removal expansions.  This has the effect of no longer performing
	  quote removal on the pattern before trying to match it.  This
	  fixes an incompatibility with ksh93 reported on comp.unix.shell

nojobs.c
	- add replacement function for siginterrupt on the off chance that a
	  system has posix signals but lacks siginterrrupt

lib/readline/display.c
	- fix from Tim Waugh at Red Hat to speed up inserting characters into
	  long lines in a UTF-8 environment by optimizing the calculation of
	  the first difference between old and new lines by checking to see
	  whether the old line is a subset of the new

				   11/29
				   -----
lib/malloc/stats.c
	- break code that opens file (and interprets %p) into separate function
	  _imalloc_fopen(char *s, char *fn, char *def, char *defbuf, size_t defsiz)
	  for use by rest of library
	- default stats file is now `stats.PID'

lib/malloc/trace.c
	- new function, malloc_set_tracefn (char *s, char *fn), sets tracing
	  to the file named by FN (with %p interpolated as the pid), using
	  some default if FN is NULL

lib/malloc/shmalloc.h
	- new extern declaration for malloc_set_tracefn

				   12/4
				   ----
execute_cmd.c
	- combined several common strings from do_piping() into one
	  dup_error() function

builtins/common.[ch]
	- new function, `sh_notbuiltin(s)' prints error message about s not
	  being a shell builtin

builtins/{builtin,enable}.def
	- call sh_notbuiltin instead of using literal string

{arrayfunc,expr,error}.c
	- use one string variable for `bad array subscript' error message; use
	  in calls to various error reporting functions

Makefile.in
	- add variables for localedir and the PACKAGE_* variables, auto-set
	  by configure

configure.in
	- un-cache values for gettext, textdomain, and bindtextdomain if they're
	  not in libc but in libintl so the right variables get set

bashintl.h
	- add necessary defines for marking strings to be translated using
	  gettext

locale.c
	- set textdomain and directory in set_default_locale
	- don't call textdomain with the value of $TEXTDOMAIN, since we don't
	  want to override the default domain ("bash")
	- don't call bindtextdomain unless default_domain already has a value
	- when translating $"..." strings, use dgettext with the script's
	  default domain (value of $TEXTDOMAIN)

				   12/9

builtins/mkbuiltins.c
	- include "bashintl.h" in the generated "builtins.c"

aclocal.m4
	- add m4 files from gettext distribution needed by libintl

configure.in
	- create po/Makefile.in and lib/intl/Makefile in AC_OUTPUT
	- add call to AM_GNU_GETTEXT to initialize gettext stuff

Makefile.in
	- use mkinstalldirs instead of mkdirs in the `installdirs' target
	- changes for intl/ and po/ subdirectories in build and install
	- changes to have libintl linked in, as determined by configure
	- changes to have libintl built, just in case it's used (though I'd
	  rather not)

				   12/10
				   -----
config.h.in
	- additional #defines required by the libintl library
	- add ENABLE_NLS define for AM_GNU_GETTEXT
	- take out defines for HAVE_{BINDTEXTDOMAIN,GETTEXT,TEXTDOMAIN}

configure.in
	- removed old tests for libintl and gettext/textdomain/bindtextdomain

locale.c
	- remove HAVE_GETTEXT code; we have gettext unconditionally now

bashintl.h
	- change to include "gettext.h" and remove the conditional code based
	  on whether or not gettext is present

				   12/16
				   -----
lib/readline/vi_mode.c

include/shmbutil.h
	- two new macros:  BACKUP_CHAR(str, strsize, i), which backs up one
	  multibyte character in STR starting at index I, and
	  BACKUP_CHAR_P(str, strsize, p), which backs up one multibyte
	  character in STR starting at P, which is a char *

				    1/6
				    ---
pcomplete.c
	- in pcomp_filename_completion_function, use the quote character
	  readline found (and assigned to rl_complete_quote_character) when
	  dequoting the filename by a completion call from readline (when
	  rl_dispatching != 0)

bashline.c

lib/readline/doc/rltech.texi
	- documented rl_completion_found_quote

lib/readline/complete.c
	- in compute_lcd_of_matches, if it looks like what the user typed was
	  dequoted before generating filename matches, dequote the user's
	  text again before figuring out the case-insensitive lcd

				    1/9
				    ---
lib/readline/display.c
	- fix from Edward Catmur <ed@catmur.co.uk> to logic that handles
	  invisible characters in prompt string.  Original code was wrong
	  about local_prompt_prefix; it gave incorrect results when prompt
	  contained invisible characters after a line break

				   1/10
				   ----
subst.c
	- new function, mb_substring(), does character (possibly multibyte)
	  oriented rather than strictly byte-oriented substring extraction.
	  The passed indices, rather than strictly indexing into the string,
	  indicate character positions that need to be calculated.  From
	  Tim Waugh <twaugh@redhat.com>
	- change parameter_brace_substring to use mb_substring if necessary

included/shmbutil.h
	- new define SADD_MBQCHAR_BODY, common code for adding a quoted
	  (preceded by CTLESC) multibyte character to an accumulating string
	  in the subst.c expansion code

subst.c
	- use SADD_MBQCHAR_BODY in expand_word_internal
	- new static function, mb_getcharlens, allocates and returns an array
	  of character lengths for (possibly multibyte) characters in the
	  argument string
	- change pattern matching operations to use while loops instead of
	  for loops to handle multibyte characters better (no more simple
	  increment or decrement)
	- change pattern matching operations to use multibyte character
	  operations instead of simple increments and decrements.  Don't
	  use BACKUP_CHAR_P -- use the mblen array instead, because that
	  avoids the N**2 behavior of having to count from the beginning
	  of the string each time you want to back up one character.  Changes

				   1/12
				   ----
lib/readline/display.c
	- make expand_prompt count multbyte characters in the prompt string

				   1/13
				   ----
lib/readline/display.c
	- expand_prompt takes a new reference argument -- it returns
	  the actual count of (possibly multibyte) characters displayed
	  on the screen
	- don't short-circuit in expand_prompt unless we're not going to
	  be using any multibyte characters
	- change calls  to expand_prompt to pass an argument for the
	  number of physical characters the prompt occupies
	  (prompt_physical_chars)
	- initialize `lpos' (the physical cursor position) from
	  prompt_physical_chars in rl_redisplay

lib/readline/mbutil.c
	- in _rl_find_prev_mbchar_internal, if mbrtowc returns -1 or -2, and
	  we assume that the character is a single-byte char, make sure we
	  update `prev' so it doesn't get lost.  Fixes problems encountered

configure.in
	- add libintl build directory to the list of include directories if

doc/{bash.1,bashref.texi}
	- document new behavior of \W

subst.c
	- make sure parameter_brace_expand_rhs uses the first character of

jobs.h
	- new possible value for a job spec return value:  BAD_JOBSPEC
	  (for syntactically invalid specs, like the empty string)

shell.c
	- in open_shell_script, check to see whether or not we can find and
	  open the filename argument before setting dollar_vars[0] or
	  manipulating BASH_SOURCE, so the error messages come out better

subst.c
	- in string_list_internal, short-circuit right away to savestring()

lib/readline/rltypedefs.h

lib/readline/doc/rltech.texi
	- documented rl_completion_word_break_hook

lib/readline/kill.c
	- added new rl_unix_filename_rubout, which deletes one filename

	  r_duplicating_output_word to r_err_and_out (as the expansion code
	  in redir.c does) so it prints without a leading `1' (file
	  descriptor)

				    2/5
				    ---
aclocal.m4
	- add a check for wcsdup to BASH_CHECK_MULTIBYTE

config.h.in
	- add HAVE_WCSDUP define

				    2/9
				    ---
builtins/shift.def
	- fix a call to sh_erange that possibly dereferences a NULL pointer

				   2/12
				   ----
general.c
	- start at a general set of file property checking functions:
	  file_isdir(), file_iswdir() (is writable directory)

general.h
	- extern declarations for new functions

lib/sh/tmpfile.c
	- use file_iswdir() to make sure the temporary directory used for
	  here documents and other temp files is writable in get_sys_tmpdir()

				   2/17
				   ----
bashline.c
	- fix conditional binding of emacs-mode M-~ -- there is a default
	  binding for it (rl_tilde_expand), so a straight call to
	  rl_bind_key_if_unbound_in_map doesn't do the right thing

				   2/27
				   ----
[bash-3.0-beta1 released]

				   2/29
				   ----
subst.c
	- fixed expansion so referencing $a, when a is an array variable
	  without an element assigned to index 0, exits the shell when
	  `-u' is enabled

expr.c
	- make the exponentiation operator (**) associative, so things like
	  2**3**4  work right (change `if' to `while')

				    3/3
				    ---
lib/sh/strftime.c
	- SCO Unix 3.2, like Solaris, requires that the system's `timezone'
	  variable be declared as long

lib/readline/{bind,histfile,input,parens}.c
	- changes for Tandem (including `floss.h' (?))

				    3/4
				    ---
subst.c
	- change param_expand to quote the entire expanded string instead
	  of just the escape characters if the expansion appears between
	  double quotes or in a here-document (for simple variable expansions
	  or expansions of positional parameters)

				    3/8
				    ---
subst.c
	- analogous changes to parameter_brace_expand_word to fix the same
	  quoting problem as on 3/4; fix callers to understand that  the
	  value returned might be quoted now and should be dequoted if
	  necessary
	- add a `quoted' argument to get_var_and_type, change callers
	- change today's fix and fix from 3/4 to not call quote_string if the
	  value is "" (because quote_string turns that into CTLNUL\0)

				    3/9
				    ---
builtins/cd.def
	- resetpwd() now takes a `caller' argument so it can be used by pwd
	  as well as cd
	- change pwd_builtin to call resetpwd() if sh_physpath() fails to
	  return a valid pathname

				   3/14
				   ----
expr.c
	- reworked exp0 and readtok() to make post-increment and post-decrement
	  into real tokens, which may be separated from their accompanying
	  variables by whitesapce
	- made analogous changes to readtok() to make pre-increment and
	  pre-decrement work when separated from their accompanying identifier
	  by whitespace

				   3/18
				   ----
lib/readline/misc.c
	- in rl_maybe_unsave_line, don't force rl_replace_line to clear
	  the undo_list, since it might point directly at an undo list
	  from a history entry (to which we have no handle)

				   3/19
				   ----
lib/readline/display.c
	- rl_save_prompt and rl_restore_prompt now save and restore the value
	  of prompt_physical_chars
	- set prompt_physical_chars in rl_redisplay when expand_prompt has
	  not been called (e.g., when rl_display_prompt is set and is not
	  equal to rl_prompt, like when searching)

lib/readline/histexpand.c
	- don't call add_history in history_expand if the `:p' modifier is
	  supplied; leave that to the calling application.  This means that
	  `history -p', for example, will not add anything to the history
	  list (as documented), nor will history expansions invoked by
	  emacs-mode M-C-e line editing

config-bot.h
	- check whether HAVE_DECL_SYS_SIGLIST is defined to 1 rather than just
	  defined, to work around newer versions of autoconf defining it to 0

config.h.in
	- change default status of HAVE_MALLOC to #undef instead of #define

bashhist.c
	- extern declarations for rl_done and rl_dispatching
	- don't call re_edit from pre_process_line unless rl_dispatcing is zero,
	  so we don't call it from something like shell-expand-line
	- change pre_process_line to add an expanded history specification
	  that returned `print only' to the history list, since history_expand
	  no longer does it (and, when using readline, do it only when
	  rl_dispatching is zero)

				   3/22
				   ----
config.h.in,aclocal.m4
	- change bash-specific functions that look in struct dirent to define
	  HAVE_STRUCT_DIRENT_xxx, like AC_CHECK_MEMBERS does (though the
	  functions are otherwise the same)
	- new function, BASH_STRUCT_DIRENT_D_NAMLEN, define
	  HAVE_STRUCT_DIRENT_D_NAMLEN if struct dirent has a `d_namlen' member

configure.in
	- call BASH_STRUCT_DIRENT_D_NAMLEN

include/posixdir.h
	- use new and renamed HAVE_STRUCT_DIRENT_D_xxx defines

				    4/7
				    ---
builtins/cd.def
	- ensure that we print out a non-null pathname after getting a
	  directory from CDPATH and canonicalizing it (e.g., if the result
	  exceeds PATH_MAX in length and the_current_working_directory is
	  set to NULL)

				   4/12
				   ----
print_cmd.c
	- new function to print out assignment statements when `set -x' has
	  been enabled: xtrace_print_assignment

externs.h
	- extern declaration for xtrace_print_assignment

				   4/13
				   ----
{subst,variables}.c
	- call xtrace_print_assignment instead of using inline code

jobs.c
	- if turning on job control when it was previously off, set
	  pipeline_pgrp to 0 in set_job_control so make_child puts
	  subsequent children in their own process group

				   4/14
				   ----
general.c
	- new function, legal_alias_name, called to decide whether an
	  argument to add_alias is a valid alias name -- essentially any
	  character except one which must be quoted to the shell parser
	  and `/'

general.h
	- new extern declaration for legal_alias_name

builtins/alias.def
	- `unalias' now returns failure status if no NAME arguments are
	  supplied and -a is not given
	- call legal_alias_name to make sure alias name is valid before
	  calling add_alias from alias_builtin

				   4/19
				   ----
include/shmbutil.h
	- include <config.h> for definition of HANDLE_MULTIBYTE rather than
	  duplicating logic

				   4/20
				   ----

doc/{bash.1,bashref.texi}
	- make sure $0 is consistently referred to as a `special parameter'
	- document which characters are now not allowed in alias names

				   4/23
				   ----

builtins/{jobs,kill,wait}.def
	- removed requirement that job control be enabled to use job control
	  notation, as SUSv3 implies

subst.c
	- based on a message from David Korn, change param_expand to not call
	  string_list_dollar_star if the only quoting is Q_HERE_DOCUMENT --
	  quoted here documents are like double quoting, but not exactly
	- analogous changes to list_remove_pattern and pos_params

				   4/24
				   ----
lib/readline/doc/rluser.texi
	- fix error in description of emacs-mode C-xC-e command (uses $VISUAL
	  instead of $FCEDIT)

				   4/28
				   ----
support/bashbug.sh
	- integrate a patch from Stefan Nordhausen
	  <nordhaus@informatik.hu-berlin.de> that reduces race conditions
	  by using a temporary directory inside $TMPDIR and creating the
	  temp files in that

				   4/30
				   ----
builtins/common.c
	- use pathconf(".", _PC_PATH_MAX) where available to size the argument
	  to getcwd() rather than using a straight PATH_MAX

builtins/cd.def
	- if get_working_directory fails and returns null (causing resetpwd
	  to return NULL), use set_working_directory to set $PWD to the
	  absolute pathname for which chdir just succeeded

				    5/1
				    ---
lib/readline/vi_mode.c
	- in rl_vi_change_to, call _rl_vi_set_last with rl_numeric_arg instead
	  of `last', since they're equal at call time and rl_vi_domove can
	  change rl_numeric_arg (which vi apparently updates).  Fixes redo bug
	  of `c2....' reported by Marion Berryman <mwberryman@copper.net>

				    5/4
				    ---
parse.y
	- fix decode_prompt_string to properly deal with strftime() returning 0

				    5/6
				    ---
variables.c
	- in make_local_array_variable, return an already-existing local array
	  variable immediately rather than creating a new array (causing a
	  memory leak)

				    5/8
				    ---
lib/readline/vi_mode.c
	- change rl_vi_domove to set rl_explicit_arg before calling
	  rl_digit_loop1 so that multi-digit numeric arguments work right
	- _rl_vi_last_command is no longer static

lib/readline/rlprivate.h
	- new extern declaration for _rl_vi_last_command

lib/readline/text.c
	- change rl_newline to only call _rl_vi_reset_last if the last command
	  (_rl_vi_last_command) is not a text modification command.  This lets
	  the last-command and last-argument work across command lines

				   5/13
				   ----
builtins/common.c
	- use getcwd(0,0) rather than providing a fixed pathname with a fixed
	  length (PATH_MAX) so getcwd() will allocate sufficient memory

aclocal.m4
	- change BASH_FUNC_GETCWD to check whether or not getcwd(0,0) will
	  allocate memory for the returned value -- nobody implements that
	  and getcwd-via-popen, so it should capture the old test as well

				   5/27
				   ----

builtins/trap.def
	- the historical behavior of assuming that a signal's handling should
	  be set to its original disposition is only in effect if a single
	  argument is given, otherwise the first argument is assumed to be a
	  command to execute
	- when in posix mode, if trap gets a single argument, display an
	  error message and return EX_USAGE
	- change the help message and usage string to better explain trap's
	  behavior

doc/{bash.1,bashref.texi}
	- describe the new default behavior when the first argument is a
	  signal spec
	- note that signal names are case insensitive and the SIG prefix is
	  optional in arguments to `trap'
	- note that signal name arguments to `kill' are case-insensitive

lib/readline/display.c
	- make sure rl_on_new_line_with_prompt sets rl_display_prompt to
	  rl_prompt (just to make sure it's set)
	- have rl_on_new_line_with_prompt use local_prompt if it's set

				    6/2
				    ---
subst.c
	- in string_extract_double_quoted, cope with extract_delimited_string
	  returning NULL, as it can when attempting completion on an unclosed
	  command substitution

				   6/24
				   ----
lib/readline/complete.c
	- change print_filename to add a `/' to listed directory names if
	  `mark-directories' has been enabled

builtins/umask.def
	- make sure that the mask passed to parse_symbolic_mode has all but
	  the operative low eight bits masked off, to avoid complementing
	  all 0s to -1, which is the error return code.  This makes things
	  like `a=rwx' and `ugo=rwx' work and turn off the umask

				   6/26
				   ----
builtins/getopts.def
	- when `getopts' reaches the end of options, unset OPTARG before
	  returning EOF.  In response to a bug report from Apple

configure.in
	- when cross-compiling, don't set CPPFLAGS_FOR_BUILD and
	  LDFLAGS_FOR_BUILD from CPPFLAGS and LDFLAGS, respectively, since
	  those are for the target instead of the build platform (report
	  from robert@schwebel.de)

shell.c
	- a shell whose standard error (but not standard output) is directed
	  to a terminal should be interactive, according to POSIX/SUS.  This
	  means that sh > sh.out will start an interactive shell.  Bug report
	  from llattanzi@apple.com

doc/{bash.1,bashref.texi}
	- change mention of standard output to standard error in definition
	  of interactive shell

lib/readline/vi_mode.c
	- new convenience function, rl_vi_start_inserting, calls
	  _rl_vi_set_last to save the last textmod command state and then calls
	  rl_vi_insertion_mode to enter insert mode
	- change functions to use rl_vi_start_inserting

lib/readline/readline.h
	- extern declaration for rl_vi_start_inserting

bashline.c
	- new function for vi-mode completion, bash_vi_complete.  Does
	  filename expansion as POSIX specifies, unlike the default readline
	  bindings (which don't know about globbing).  Bound to `\', `*',
	  and `=' in vi command keymap.  Internals very similar to
	  rl_vi_complete; just calls bash glob expansion functions

lib/readline/vi_mode.c
	- change rl_vi_change_char so that an entire change is a single
	  undoable event, rather than each individual change in a [count]r
	  command
	- fix rl_vi_change_char so that replacing characters up to EOL works
	  rather than generating rl_ding
	- fix rl_vi_change_case so that replacing characters up to EOL works
	  rather than generating rl_ding

				   6/28
				   ----
builtins/echo.def
	- call clearerr(stdout) before writing anything and testing its
	  failure or success

				   6/29
				   ----
bashline.c
	- only set rl_explicit_arg in bash_glob_complete_word if readline is
	  in emacs mode; let bash_vi_complete take care of setting it in vi
	  mode
	- fix bash_vi_complete to only set rl_explicit_arg unless the posix
	  conditions are met: no globbing characters in the vi `bigword'
	  being completed

lib/readline/complete.c
	- make sure `extension_char' is initialized before deciding whether
	  or not the append a `/' to a possible completion when visible-stats
	  is not enabled

				    7/2
				    ---
subst.c
	- fix a boundary overrun in string_extract_double_quoted that could
	  occur when the word completion code attempts to expand an incomplete
	  construct (like a quoted unclosed command substitution)

				    7/4
				    ---
subst.c
	- set tempenv_assign_error to non-zero if an assignment to the
	  temporary environment fails for some reason (e.g., attempted
	  assignment to a readonly variable)

execute_cmd.c
	- fix execute_simple_command to force a non-interactive shell in
	  POSIX mode to exit if an assignment to the temporary environment
	  preceding a special builtin fails (bug report from
	  llattanzi@apple.com)

				    7/5
				    ---
bashline.c
	- in bash_directory_completion_hook, don't perform word expansions
	  if the filename appears to have been completed from the file
	  system rather than typed in by the user.  Bug reported by Tim
	  Waugh <twaugh@redhat.com>

				    7/7
				    ---
lib/readline/misc.c
	- if _rl_maybe_save_line is being asked to save a line other than
	  what's already saved, free up the current saved line and save the
	  current contents of rl_line_buffer.  Bug reported by
	  llattanzi@apple.com

				   7/12
				   ----
lib/readline/input.c
	- do better EOF detection in rl_gather_tyi -- if a read returns 0 when
	  the fd is in non-blocking mode, stuff an EOF into the input stream
	  (reported by mattias@virtutech.se)

				   7/13
				   ----
lib/readline/vi_mode.c
	- make sure rl_vi_put honors `count' arguments and yanks things
	  multiple times if requested

				   7/16
				   ----
builtins/umask.def
	- make sure that the `who' part of the umask symbolic mode argument
	  defaults to `a' if it's missing

flags.c
	- make sure that maybe_make_restricted only gets called after the
	  shell is initialized, so `bash -r' doesn't result in inappropriate
	  error messages
