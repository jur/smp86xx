  <li><b>13 January 2005 -- Bug and Patch Tracking</b><p>

    Bug reports sometimes get lost when posted to the mailing list.  The
    developers of uClibc are busy people, and have only so much they can keep
    in their brains at a time. In my case, I'm lucky if I can remember my own
    name, much less a bug report posted last week... To prevent your bug report
    from getting lost, if you find a bug in uClibc, please use the
    <a href="http://bugs.uclibc.org/">shiny new Bug and Patch Tracking System</a>
    to post all the gory details.

    <p>

    The same applies to patches... Regardless of whether your patch
    is a bug fix or adds spiffy new features, please post your patch
    to the Bug and Patch Tracking System to make certain it is
    properly considered.

    <li> <b>12 January 2005, uClibc 0.9.27 Released</b>
    <br>

    CodePoet Consulting is pleased to announce the release of
    uClibc 0.9.27.  Release highlights include a new stdio core,
    Linux 2.6.x support, a much improved shared library loader,
    support for several new architectures, and of course fixes for
    the usual pile of bugs.

    <p>

    Due primarily to the stdio changes, this release is NOT binary
    compatible with uClibc 0.9.26 or any earlier release, so be
    prepared to recompile your software if you are still using an
    old version of uClibc.  Sorry for the pain...

    <p>

    Updated uClibc development systems using uClibc 0.9.27, along
    with the uClibc buildroot and source code used to compile these
    development systems, have also been released and are available
    from the uclibc.org downloads area.

    <p>
