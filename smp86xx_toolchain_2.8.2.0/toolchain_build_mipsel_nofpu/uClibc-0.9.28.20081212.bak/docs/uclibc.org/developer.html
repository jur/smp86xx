<h3>Subversion Read/Write Access</h3>

If you want to be able to commit things to Subversion, first contribute some
stuff to show you are serious.  Then, very nicely ask <a
href="mailto:andersen@codepoet.org">Erik Andersen</a> if he will set you up
with an commit access to the Subversion repository.  To access Subversion, you
will want to add the following to set up your environment:

<p>

To obtain commit access, you will need to demonstrate you are serious by
submitting a few good patches first.  Then, you will need to select a username
to use when committing stuff, and finally, you will need to send me the
username you have selected, an ssh key, and the email address where you prefer
email to be sent (I will forward any email sent to you, but not store it).

<p>

Note that if you would prefer to keep your communications with me
private, you can encrypt your email using my
<a href="http://www.codepoet.org/andersen/erik/gpg.asc">public key</a>.

<p>

Once you are setup with an account, you will need to use your account to
checkout a copy of uClibc from Subversion:

<pre>
svn list svn+ssh://username@svn.uclibc.org/svn/trunk/uClibc</pre>
<br>
It goes without saying you must change <em>username</em> to your own
username...
<p>

You can then enter the newly checked out uClibc directory, make changes, check
your changes, diff your changes, revert your changes, and and commit your
changes usine commands such as:

<pre>
svn diff
svn status
svn revert
svn commit</pre>

<p>
